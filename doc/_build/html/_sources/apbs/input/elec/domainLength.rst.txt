This length may be different in each direction.
If the :ref:`usemesh` keyword is included, then this command is ignored.
The syntax is:

.. code-block:: bash

   domainLength {xlen ylen zlen}

where the parameters ``xlen ylen zlen`` are floating point numbers that specify the mesh lengths in the x-, y-, and z-directions (respectively) in units of Ã….
