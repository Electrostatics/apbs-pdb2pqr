This keyword can be used to load in the surface integral matrices previously generated by PB-SAM named as :file:`mol{m}sph{s}.bin` for molecule ID *s* and coarse-grained sphere *s* (see :ref:`pbamauto` for more information).
The syntax is:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   imat {prefix}

where ``prefix`` is the filename prefix :file:`mol{m}sph`.
The :file:`{s}.bin` will be appended during the program run.

.. todo::

   It would be better to generalize the :ref:`read` section of the input file rather than use the ``imat`` command.
   This command also needs to be cleaned up -- it's too fragile.
