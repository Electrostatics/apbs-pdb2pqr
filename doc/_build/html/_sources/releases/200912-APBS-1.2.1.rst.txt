Bug fixes
==============

* Added in warning into focusFillBound if there is a large value detected in setting the boundary conditions during a focusing calculation
* Added in a check and abort in Vpmg_qmEnergy if chopped values are detected. This occurs under certain conditions for NPBE calculations where focusing cuts into a low-dielectric regions.
* Fixed a bug in Vpmg_MolIon that causes npbe based calculations to return very large energies.  This occurs under certain conditions for NPBE calculations where focusing cuts into a low-dielectric regions.
