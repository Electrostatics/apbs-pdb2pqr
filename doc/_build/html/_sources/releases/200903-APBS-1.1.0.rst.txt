APBS 1.1.0 (2009-03)
====================

=====================
New features
=====================

* Moved APBS user guide and tutorial to MediaWiki
* Added in support for OpenMPI for parallel calculations
* Added in command line support for Opal job submissions (Code by Samir Unni)
* Allowed pathname containing spaces in input file, as long as the whole pathname is in quotes ("")
* Documented 'make test' and related features

======================
Modifications
======================

* Modified the function bcCalc to march through the data array linearly when setting boundary conditions. This removes duplication of grid points on the edge of the array and corners.
* Clarified documentation on the IDs assigned to input maps, PQRs, parameter files, etc.
* pdated tutorial to warn against spaces in APBS working directory path in VMD; updated user guide to warn against spaces in APBS installation path on Windows
* 'make test' has been reconfigured to run before issuing make install (can be run from top directory)
* Removed tools/visualization/vmd from tools directory in lieu of built-in support in VMD
* Path lengths can now be larger than 80 characters
* Expanded authorship list
* Added in 'make test-opal' as a post install test (run from the examples install directory)
* Added additional concentrations to protein-rna test case to better encompass experimental conditions used by Garcia-Garcia and Draper; this improves agreement with the published data

=========
Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed typos in User Guide (ion keyword) and clarified SMPBE keyword usage
* Fixed typo in User Guide (writemat: poission -> poisson)
* Updated psize.py with Robert's patch to fix inconsistent assignment of fine grid numbers in some (very) rare cases
* Fixed bug with boundary condition assignment.  This could potentially affect all calculations; however, probably has limited impact:  many test cases gave identical results after the bug fix; the largest change in value was < 0.07%.
