PDB2PQR 1.2.1 (2007-04)
=======================

------------
New features
------------

* Updated documentation to include instructions for pdb2pka support, references, more pydoc documents.
* Added ligand examples to examples/ directory
* Added native support for the TYL06 forcefield.  For more information on this forcefield please see Tan C, Yang L, Luo R.  How well does Poisson-Boltzmann implicit solvent agree with explicit solvent? A quantitative analysis. Journal of Physical Chemistry B.  110 (37), 18680-7, 2006. 
* Added a new HTML output page which relays the different atom types between the AMBER and CHARMM forcefields for a generated PQR file (thanks to the anonymous reviewers of the latest PDB2PQR paper).

---------
Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed bug where a segmentation fault would occur in PropKa if the N atom was not the first atom listed in the residue
* Fixed error message that occurred when a blank line was found in a parameter file.
* Better error handling in MOL2 file parsing.
* Fixed bug where ligands were not supported on PDB files with multiple MODEL fields.
