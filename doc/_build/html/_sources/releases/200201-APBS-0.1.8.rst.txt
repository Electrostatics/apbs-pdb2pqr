APBS 0.1.8 (2002-01)
====================

This version is a public (beta) release candidate and includes the following bug-fixes:


* Added warning to parallel focusing 
* Added several test cases and validated the current version of the code for all but one (see examples/README.html)
* Fixed atom partitioning bug and external energy evaluation during focusing
* Added new program for converting OpenDX format files to MOLMOL (by Jung-Hsin Lin)


You should definitely upgrade, the previous versions may produce unreliable results.
