APBS 0.1.5 (2001-10)
====================

This version features minor bug fixes and several new features:


* Fixed shift in center of geometry for OpenDX I/O
* Made energy evaluation more robust when using NPBE
* Rearrangments of files and modified compilation behavior
* Input file support for ion species of varying valency and concentration
* Input file support incorrect nlev/dime combinations; APBS now finds acceptable settings near to the user's requested values
* "Automatic focusing".  Users now simply specify the physical parameters (temperature, dielectric, etc.), the coarse and fine grid lengths and centers, and APBS calculates the rest
