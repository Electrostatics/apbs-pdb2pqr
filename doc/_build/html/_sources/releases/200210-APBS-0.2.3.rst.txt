APBS 0.2.3 (2002-10)
====================

* Fixed bugs in salt-dependent Helmholtz/nonlinear term of PBE affecting both LPBE and NPBE calculations.  While this bug fix only changes most energies by < 2 kJ/mol, it is recommended that all users upgrade.  Many thanks to Michael Grabe for finding and carefully documenting this bug!
* A parameter (chgm) has been added which controls the charge discretization method used.  Therefore, this version contains substantial changes in both the API and input file syntax.  Specifically:
    
    * PBEparm has two new members (chgm, setchgm)
    * Vpmg_fillco requires another argument
    * Vpmg_*Force functions require additional arguments
    * Input files must now contain the keyword "chgm #" where # is an integer
    * Please see the documentation for more information.
    
* Fixed problems with "slicing" off chunks of the mesh during I/O of focused calculations
* Updated authors list
* New CHARMM parameters -- Robert Konecny
* Created enumerations for common surface and charge discretization methods
* Added Vmgrid class to support easy manipulation of nested grid data
* Added more verbosity to error with NPBE forces
* Added working Python wrappers -- Todd Dolinksy
* Modified VMD scripts read_dx and loadstuff.vmd
