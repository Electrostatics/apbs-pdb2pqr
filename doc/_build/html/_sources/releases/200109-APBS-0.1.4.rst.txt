APBS 0.1.4 (2001-09)
====================


This version features major bug fixes introduced in the 0.1.3 release:


* Chain ID support has been **removed** from the PDB/PQR parser (if anyone has a nice, flexible PDB parser they'd like to contribute to the code, I'd appreciate it)
* Configure script has been made compatible with OSF
* Bug fix in disabling FEtk-specific header files
