APBS-PDB2PQR examples and tutorials
===================================

Please see the `PDB2PQR documentation <http://pdb2pqr.readthedocs.io>`_ for PDB2PQR-specific examples.

===================
APBS examples
===================

APBS examples start with a PQR file (e.g., generated by PDB2PQR).
Some of these examples can be performed through the PDB2PQR web interface but most require a command-line APBS program.

===================
Visualizing results
===================

There are several programs available for visualizing APBS results.
The easiest is the PDB2PQR web server which provides `3Dmol.js <http://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/>` and `Jmol <http://jmol.sourceforge.net/>` browser-based visualization capabilities.

Other programs include:

* `PyMOL <http://www.pymol.org>`_
* `VMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_
* `PMV <http://mgltools.scripps.edu/>`_
* `Chimera <https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/>`_
