Linking APBS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on APBS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.
 
SPECIAL GPL EXCEPTION
In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of APBS
give you permission to combine the APBS program with free software
programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with
code included in releases of ISIM, PMV, PyMOL, SMOL, VMD.  This
special exception permission is also extended to any software listed
in the SPECIAL GPL EXCEPTION clauses by the PMG, FEtk, MC, or MALOC
libraries.
 
Note that people who make modified versions of APBS are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
