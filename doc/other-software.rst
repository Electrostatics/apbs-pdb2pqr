Dynamics simulations
====================

The `iAPBS <https://mccammon.ucsd.edu/iapbs/>`_ library was developed to facilitate the integration of APBS with other molecular simulation packages.
This library has enabled the integration of APBS with several molecular dynamics packages, including `NAMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/>`_, `AMBER <http://ambermd.org/>`_, and `CHARMM <https://www.charmm.org/charmm/>`_.

APBS is also used directly by Brownian dynamics software such as `SDA <https://mcm.h-its.org/sda/>`_ and `BrownDye <http://browndye.ucsd.edu/>`_.
