Harwell-Boeing matrix format
============================

This is the sparse matrix output format used by APBS for analyses of the matrix operators which are constructed during PB solution.
This format was implemented so matrix operators could by decomposed with SuperLU and ARPACK but this also serves as a useful general mechanism for sparse matrix input and output.
