	<chapter id="introduction-sect"> <title>How to read this tutorial</title>

		<para>This tutorial is designed as a "how to" document to get
			users acquainted with computational electrostatics
			calculations using APBS.  In order to perform the
			provided examples, you will need the latest version of
			APBS (<ulink url="&apbsurl;">&apbsurl;</ulink>).  Other
			requirements are listed in the individual
			sections.</para>

		<important>
			<para>Note that many of the examples in this tutorial
				can also be run through the web-based <ulink
					url="http://gemstone.mozdev.org/">Gemstone</ulink>
				service without the need for local
				installations of the APBS software.  More
				information is available in <xref
					linkend="gemstone-sect"/>.
			</para>
		</important>

		<warning>
			<para> This document is still under construction and
				should be completed before the next

	<chapter id="pdb2pqr-sect"> <title>How do I get my structure ready for
			electrostatics calculations?</title>

		<para>
			In order to perform electrostatics calculations on your
			biomolecular structure of interest, you need to provide
			atomic charge and radius information to APBS.  Charges
			are used to form the biomolecular charge distribution
			for the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation while the radii
			are used to construct the dielectric and ionic
			accessibility functions.  This charge and radius
			information can be provided to APBS in a few different
			formats which are described in more detail below.
		</para>

		<sect1 id="pqr-format-sect"> <title>PQR format</title>
			<para>
				The <ulink url="&ugurl;#pqr-format">PQR
					format</ulink> provides a very simple
				way to include parameter information by 
				by replacing the occupancy and temperature
				columns of a PDB-format structure file with 
				charge ("Q") and radius ("R") information.
				Unfortunately, the simplicity of this format
				also limits its extensibility:  it can be very
				difficult to add new atom types and parameters
				in a generic format without the use of external
				software such as <ulink
					url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink>.
				The XML parameter format described <link
					linkend="xml-format-sect">below</link>
				is much easier to modify.
			</para>
		</sect1>

		<sect1 id="xml-format-sect"> <title>XML format</title>
			
			<para>The <ulink url="&ugurl;#pqr-xml-format">XML format</ulink> provides a somewhat more complicated format for including parameter information with increased flexibility in formatting, extension, and other modifications.  As in the PQR format, atom coordinates are supplemented with charge and radius information.  Please see <ulink url="&ugurl;#pqr-xml-format">the APBS user guide</ulink> for complete format specifications.</para>
			
		</sect1>

		<sect1 id="pdb2pqr-subsect"> <title>Generating PQR files from PDB
				files (PDB2PQR)</title>

			<note>
				<para>This tutorial was prepared using PDB2PQR 1.2.1</para>
			</note>

			<para>
				The <ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink> web service and software will convert
				most PDB files into PQR format with some caveats, in particular the inability to "repair" large regions of missing coordinates.
				Although PDB2PQR can fix some missing heavy atoms in sidechains, it does not currently have the (nontrivial) capability to model in large regions of missing backbone and sidechain coordinates.
			</para>
			<para>
				<ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink> will also perform hydrogen bond optimization,  sidechain rotamer search, limited titration state assignment, ligand parameterization, and APBS input file preparation.
				Please see <ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">&pdb2pqrurl;</ulink> for more details.
			</para>

			<para>
				As mentioned above, PDB2PQR is discussed in
				more detailed on the 
				<ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR
					homepage</ulink> .  Therefore, we will
				review the minimal steps required to produce a
				PQR file from a PDB file here.  To begin,
				choose a server from <ulink
					url="&pdb2pqrurl;#availability">&pdb2pqrurl;#availability</ulink>.
			</para>

			<sect2> <title>Choose the PDB file to convert</title>
				<para>
					Either enter the 4-character <ulink
						url="http://www.pdb.org/">PDB</ulink>
					ID or accession number (e.g., <ulink
						url="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1FAS">1FAS</ulink>,
					<ulink
						url="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1MAH">1MAH</ulink>,
					<ulink
						url="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1LYS">1LYS</ulink>,
					etc.) or upload your own PDB file.
					<note>
						<para> Note that, if you choose
							to enter a 4-character
							PDB file, PDB2PQR will
							process 
							<emphasis>all
								recognizable 
								chains</emphasis> 
							of PDB file
							<emphasis>as it was
								deposited</emphasis>
							in the PDB (e.g., not 
							the biological unit,
							any related
							transformations, etc.).
						</para>
					</note>
				</para>
			</sect2>

			<sect2 id="pdb2pqr-ff-sect"> <title>Pick a forcefield</title>
				<para>
					<emphasis>For most applications, the choice is
						easy:  PARSE.</emphasis>  This
					forcefield has been optimized for
					implicit solvent calculation and is
					probably the best choice for
					visualization of protein electrostatics
					and many common types of energetic
					calculations for proteins.  However,
					AMBER and CHARMM may be more
					appropriate if you are attempting to
					compare directly to simulations
					performed with those force fields,
					require nucleic acid support, are
					simulating ligands parameterized with
					those force fields, etc.
				</para>
				<para>
					It is also possible to upload a
					user-defined forcefield (e.g., to
					define radii and charges for ligands or
					unusual residues).  Please see the
					<ulink
						url="&pdb2pqrurl;">PDB2PQR</ulink>
					documentation for more information.
				</para>
			</sect2>

			<sect2> <title>Output naming scheme</title>

				<para>This is largely irrelevant to
					electrostatics calculations but may be
					important for visualization.  When in
					doubt, choose the "Internal naming
					scheme" which attempts to conform to
					IUPAC standards.</para>
			</sect2>

			<sect2> <title>Other options</title>

				<para>These options fall into two categories:
					how to build missing atoms (including
					hydrogens) onto the structure and
					additional output configuration. 
					Please see <ulink url="&pdb2pqrurl;">&pdb2pqrurl;</ulink> for more details.

	<chapter id="viz-sect"> <title>How do I visualize the electrostatic
potential around my biomolecule?</title>

		<para> There are a number of excellent molecular graphics
			programs which can be used to visualize electrostatic
			properties in the context of the biomolecule.  Since
			there are far too many to review in any depth, we will
			focus on the 3 packages with which we are most
			familiar. </para>

		<sect1 id="vmd-sect"> <title>VMD</title>

			<para>
				The <ulink url="&vmdurl;">VMD</ulink> molecular
				graphics software package provides support for
				both the execution of APBS and the
				visualization of the resulting electrostatic
				potentials.  Documentation on the APBS
				interface has been provided by the VMD
				developers at <ulink
					url="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/apbsrun/">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/apbsrun/</ulink>.
				We will supplement this with a basic
				demonstration of how go from a PDB entry to a
				plot of structure &amp; potential in VMD using
				APBS.
			</para>

			<note>
				<para>This tutorial was written using VMD
					1.8.5.</para>
			</note>

			<sect2> <title>Generating the PQR</title>

				<para> 
					We'll perform this example with arc
					repressor
					(PDB ID <ulink
						url="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1MYK">1MYK</ulink>),
					a DNA binding protein.  The first step
					in the visualization process is
					generating a PQR file for use with VMD
					and APBS.  Please follow the directions
					in <xref linkend="pdb2pqr-subsect"/> to
					generate a PQR file for this structure.
				</para>
			</sect2>

			<sect2> <title>Loading the PQR</title>

				<para>
					Load the PQR file you just created into
					VMD (<menuchoice>
						<guimenu>File</guimenu> 
						<guimenuitem>New molecule...</guimenuitem>
					</menuchoice> in the VMD Main window).
					Adjust the molecule to the desired
					view.
					<footnote>
						<para> At this point you may
							notice (to many users'
							chagrin) that PDB2PQR
							removed the chain IDs
							from the structure.
							Sorry about this; we're
							trying to fix it in
							future releases of APBS
							and PDB2PQR.</para>
					</footnote>
					Depending on the force
					field<footnote><para>Visualization
							seems to work best with
							PARSE</para></footnote>
					you used in PDB2PQR, you may notice
					that VMD is displaying some strange
					bonds.  When a PQR file is loaded into
					VMD, bond distances are inferred from
					the PQR radii.  These radii were chosen
					for continuum electrostatics
					calculations, not visualization.  Don't
					worry if some of the bonds appear a bit
					strange (hide the hydrogens if it
					really bothers you).

	<chapter id="solvation-sect"> <title>How do I calculate a solvation
energy?</title>

		<para>
			Solvation energies are usually decomposed into a free
			energy cycle as shown in <xref
				linkend="solvation-cycle-full"/>.  Note that
			such solvation energies often performed on fixed
			conformations; as such, they are more correctly called
			"potentials of mean force".  More details on using APBS
			for the polar and nonpolar portions of such a cycle are
			given in the following sections.
			<figure id="solvation-cycle-full"> <titleabbrev>Full
					solvation energy cycle</titleabbrev>
				<title>Full solvation energy cycle.  This cycle incorporates several processes into the solvation energy (step 1).  Step 2  indicates charging of the solute in solution (e.g., inhomogeneous dielectric,  ions present).  Step 3 indicates the introduction of attractive solute-solvent dispersive interaction interactions (e.g., an integral of Weeks-Chandler-Andersen interactions over the solvent-accessible volume).  Step 4 indicates the introduction of repulsive solute-solvent interaction (e.g., cavity formation).  Steps 5 and 6 are basically null steps although they could be used to offset unwanted energies added in Steps 3 and 4 above.  Finally, Step 6 represents the charging of the solute in a vacuum or homogeneous dielectric environment in the absence of mobile ions.</title>
				<graphic
					fileref="images/solvation-cycle-full.png"></graphic>
			</figure>
		</para>

		<sect1> <title>Polar solvation</title>
			<para> The full free energy cycle in <xref
					linkend="solvation-cycle-full"/> is
				usually decomposed into polar and nonpolar
				parts.  The polar portion is usually
				represented by the charging energies in Steps 2
				and 6:
				<informalequation>
					<graphic
						fileref="images/polar-solvation-equation.png"/>
				</informalequation>
				Energies returned from APBS electrostatics
				calculations are charging free energies.
				Therefore, to calculate the polar contribution
				to the solvation free energy, we simply need to
				setup two calculations corresponding to Steps 2
				and 6 in <xref
					linkend="solvation-cycle-full"/>.
				However, the electrostatic charging free
				energies returned by APBS include
				self-interaction terms.  These are the energies
				of a charge distribution interacting with
				itself.  Such self-interaction energies are
				typically very large and extremely sensitive to
				the problem discretization (grid spacing,
				location, etc.).  Therefore, it is very
				important that the two calculations are
				performed with identical grid spacings,
				lengths, and centers, in order to ensure
				appropriate matching (or "cancellation") of
				self-energy terms.
			</para>
			<para> One of the canonical examples for polar
				solvation is the Born ion:  a nonpolarizable
				sphere with a single charge at its center
				surrounded by an aqueous medium.  In the
				absence of external ions, the polar solvation
				energy for this sytem is given by <xref
					linkend="born-solvation-energy-equation"/>.
				<equation id="born-solvation-energy-equation">
					<title>Born ion polar solvation energy.
					q is the ion charge, a is the ion
radius, and the two epsilons denote the internal and external (solution)
dielectric constants.  This model assumes zero ionic strength.</title>
					<titleabbrev>Born ion polar solvation energy</titleabbrev>
					<graphic fileref="images/born-solvation-energy-equation.png"/>
				</equation>
				We can setup a PQR file for the Born ion for

				</example>
				We're interested in performing two APBS
				calculations for the charging free energies in
				homogeneous and heterogeneous dielectric
				coefficients.  We'll assume the internal
				dielectric coefficient is 1 (e.g., a vacuum)
				and the external dielectric coefficient is
				78.54 (e.g., water).

		<sect1> <title>Apolar solvation</title>
		
			<para>Referring back to the full free energy cycle in <xref linkend="solvation-cycle-full"/>, the nonpolar solvation free energy is usually represented by the energy changes in Steps 3 through 5:
				<informalequation>
					<graphic fileref="images/nonpolar-solvation-equation.png"/>
				</informalequation>
				where Step 4 represents the energy of creating a cavity in solution and Steps 3-5 is the energy associated with dispersive interactions between the solute and solvent.
				There are many possible choices for modeling this nonpolar solvation process.  APBS implements a relatively general model described by <ulink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0600118103">Wagoner and Baker (PNAS 2006)</ulink> and references therein.  
				The implementation and invocation of this model is described in more detail in <ulink url="&ugurl;#apolar">the APBS user guide</ulink>.
			</para>
			<para>
				Our basic model for the cavity creation term (Step 4) is motivated by scaled particle theory and has the form
				<informalequation>
					<graphic fileref="images/nonpolar-solvation-cavity-equation.png"/>
				</informalequation>
				where p is the solvent pressure (<literal>press</literal> keyword in APBS), &Delta; V is the solvent-accessible volume of the solute, &gamma; is the solvent surface tension (<literal>gamma</literal> keyword in APBS), and &Delta; A is the solvent-accessible surface area of the solute.
			</para>
			<para>
				Our basic model for the dispersion terms (Steps 3 and 5) follow a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson framework as proposed by Levy, Zhang, and Gallicchio (<ulink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.10045">J Comput Chem, 2002</ulink>):
				<informalequation>
					<graphic fileref="images/nonpolar-solvation-dispersion-equation.png"/>
				</informalequation>
				where &rho; is the bulk solvent density (<literal>bconc</literal> keyword in APBS), &Omega; is the problem domain, u<superscript>(att)</superscript>(y) is the attractive dispersion interaction between the solute and the solvent at point y with dispersive Lennard-Jones parameters specified in APBS parameter files, and &theta;(y) describes the solvent accessibility of point y.
			</para>
			
			<note>
				<para>
					The ability to independently adjust <literal>press</literal>, <literal>gamma</literal>, and <literal>bconc</literal> means that the general nonpolar solvation model presented above can be easily adapted to other popular nonpolar solvation models.
					For example, setting <literal>press</literal> and <literal>bconc</literal> to zero yields a typical solvent-accessible surface area model.

				Unlike the Born ion, there are no good simple examples for demonstrating these types of nonpolar calculations.  APBS includes several examples of calculations using the apolar model above.  Interested readers should examine the <filename>alkanes</filename> apolar example provided with APBS.

				As we'll see in the next section, these model values provide the

			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2> <title> &pKa; values in proteins </title>
			<para> The role of the model &pKa; values introduced in the previous
				sections is to move all the chemical (bond making and breaking)
				complexity of protonation into the model values.  In particular,
				&pKa; values in proteins are calculated as pertubations of the model
				compounds according to the free energy cycles shown below.  </para>
			<para> The &pKa; for the amino acid in the context of the protein is given
				by the free energy cycle:
				<informalfigure id="fig:pKa_cycle"> <mediaobject> <imageobject>
							<imagedata
								fileref="images/Ka_protein_chem_eqn.png" align="center"/> </imageobject> </mediaobject> </informalfigure>
				We are interested in determining the unknown 
				&Delta;<subscript>a</subscript>G<subscript>HA</subscript> 
				from the known model 
				&Delta;<subscript>a</subscript>G<subscript>HA,model</subscript> 
				and the unknown 
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>HA</subscript> 
				and 
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>A-</subscript> 
				according to:
				<equation id="eqn:DaG"> <title>Acid dissociation free energy</title>
					<mediaobject> <imageobject> <imagedata
								fileref="images/DaG_from_cycle.png" align="center"/> </imageobject> </mediaobject>
				</equation>
			</para>
			<para> In general, the quantities
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>HA</subscript> and
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>A-</subscript> are
				obainted from a computational approach.  Nearly any free energy
				calculation method could be used to obtain these energies according
				to a scheme where the (de)solvation energies of the charged and
				uncharged amino acids are calculated according to:
				<figure id="fig:pKa_cycle_protein">
					<title>&pKa; perturbation free energy cycle schematic</title>
					<mediaobject> <imageobject> <imagedata fileref="images/pKa_protein_cycle.png" align="center"/> </imageobject> </mediaobject>
				</figure>
				Note that these energies have all assumed the same background state
				of the protein for the calculations; in other words, the same states
				are used for other titratable groups in the protein for charged and
				uncharged amino acid states.  We'll discuss the implications of this
				assumption a bit later in this tutorial.
			</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2> <title>Continuum electrostatics methods for &pKa; calculations in proteins</title>

			<para> Although nearly any free energy method could be used to evaluate the
				energies of transferring the protonated and unprotonated amino acids
				from solution into the protein environment, continuum electrostatics
				offer a (usually) satisfying compromise between accuracy and
				computational efficiency.  </para>

			<para> The transfer free energies to be calculated,
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>HA</subscript> and
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>A-</subscript>, can be
				determined from Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) energies.  In particular,
				these energies can be calculated as effective <quote>binding energy
					calculations</quote> similar to those covered in the APBS
				examples and tutorial:
				<equation id="eqn:dG_xfer"> 
					<title>Transfer free energy</title>
					<mediaobject> <imageobject> <imagedata

			</para>

			<para> Note that, as with binding energies, <xref linkend="eqn:dG_xfer"/>
				can be evaluated two ways: 
				<itemizedlist id="list:methods"> 
					<title>Ways to evaluate transfer free energies</title>
					<listitem>
						<para> Directly in a PB equation by computing the

							must be the same in each PB calculation.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Indirectly through PB calculations of

						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				Both of these methods can be combined, via free energy cycles, to
				give the desired
				&Delta;<subscript>xfer</subscript>G<subscript>X</subscript>.
				However, when care is taken to use the same grids and conformations
				for all calculations, the direct method using total electrostatic
				energies is usually the most stable.
			</para>

			<para> Note that none of the methods discussed above have explicitly allowed
				for changes in titration state of other groups in the protein during
				protonation/deprotonation of the acid group of interest.
				Additionally, none of these methods explicitly provide for
				conformational changes in the protein coupled to
				protonation/deprotonoation.  As such, we cannot claim to be
				computing true &pKa; values with this method.  Instead, we are
				calculating so-called <wordasword>intrinsic</wordasword> &pKa;
				values.  </para>

		<sect2> <title>Background</title>

			<para>Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) is a very popular system for &pKa;
				calculations as it has a number of interesting values for its
				titratable residues.  Early &pKa; work on this enzyme is presented
				in <ulink

				this lab.  More recent &pKa; calculations and a review of some of
				the methodology can be found in <ulink

			<para>HEWL has two active site residues GLU 35 and ASP 52 whose titration

			<para>We're going to need to generate a protonated form of GLU 35 to perform
				our &pKa; calculations.  We will do this with the <ulink
					url="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/">PDB2PQR web

					homepage</ulink>.
			</para>

			<para>
				Unless otherwise directed, PDB2PQR adds hydrogens to residues based
				on model &pKa; values.  Therefore, we will need to specify the
				titration state of GLU 35 for our &pKa; calculation by changing the
				residue name from <varname>GLU</varname> to <varname>GLH</varname>
				using <ulink url="http://www.vim.org/">your favorite text
					editor</ulink>.  Save the result as
				<filename>2LZT-GLH35.pdb</filename>
			</para>

			<para>
				We're now ready to run PDB2PQR to generate protonated versions of
				our PDB files.  Use the command line version of PDB2PQR or one of
				the web servers listed on the <ulink
					url="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/">PDB2PQR
					homepage</ulink> to generate protonoated PQR files for for
				<filename>2LZT-GLU35.pdb</filename> and
				<filename>2LZT-GLH35.pdb</filename>.  Name your results
				<filename>2LZT-GLU35.pqr</filename> and
				<filename>2LZT-GLH35.pqr</filename>, respectively.  Although it is
				always important to test sensitivity to various force fields, I'd
				recommend starting with PARSE.
			</para>

			<note>
				<para> You can use PDB2PQR to assign titration states with PROPKA
					but don't do it for the above steps since we need to set the
					titration states explicit for our calculations. </para>
			</note>

			<para>
				Recall that we're also going to need the isolated residue for our
				electrostatics calculations of intrinsic &pKa;.  Use your favorite
				text editor to extract the entire GLU 35 or GLH 35 residue from
				<filename>2LZT-GLU35.pqr</filename> and
				<filename>2LZT-GLH35.pqr</filename>.  Save the results as
				<filename>GLU35.pqr</filename> and <filename>GLH35.pqr</filename>,
				respectively.  </para>

			<para> Finally, we'll also need to perform electrostatics calculations on
				HEWL with the uncharged sidechains.  Use your favorite text editor
				to zero out the charges in <filename>2LZT-GLU35.pqr</filename> and
				<filename>2LZT-GLH35.pqr</filename> to create
				<filename>2LZT-noGLU35.pqr</filename> and

		<sect2> <title>Setting up the transfer free energy calculations</title>

			<para>Recall from our <link linkend="list:methods">earlier discussion</link>
				that the transfer free energies can be evaluated in two ways.  It is
				up to you to decide which method to use; both should give comparable
				results for a sufficiently fine grid.  As mentioned above, the
				direct subtraction of total electrostatic energies is usually the
				most stable route, assuming identical grids and solute conformations
				are used for all calculations.  </para>
			<para>  Any differences in results between these two transfer free energy
				methods are typically due to a lack of convergence in the
				calculations and can be resolved by decreasing the grid spacing
				(e.g., increasing the number of grid points).</para>

			<para> If you choose to decompose the transfer free energies into
				solvation and Coulombic energy changes, then you will need to
				perform two additional electrostatics calculations beyond the APBS
				calculations outlined in the previous section:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para> First, you will need to re-run all of your
							APBS calculations with a homogeneous
							dielectric &epss; = &epsp; to calculate
							solvation energies.  This can be
							accomplished by appropriate modification of
							the input files from the previous section.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para> Second, you will need to calculate Coulombic
							interaction energies.  The APBS program
							<command>coulomb</command> will evaluate the
							Coulomb's law electrostatic energy of a set
							of charges in a vacuum.  The program's usage
							is
							<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>coulomb foo.pqr</userinput>
							</screen>
							where <varname>foo.pqr</varname>
							is the particular PQR file you are
							interested in.  Note that this program can
							also be run with no arguments to obtain an
							expanded list of options.  <emphasis>Don't forget
								to scale by &epsp;!</emphasis> </para>

			The actin dimer example provided with the APBS

			<literal>#</literal> is the number of the
			particular processor.
		</para>
		<para>
			Running this input file with an MPI-compiled version
			of APBS runs 8 parallel focusing calculations,
			with each calculation generating fine-scale
			solutions on a different region of the
			(<literal>fglen</literal>) problem domain.
			Note that 8 separate OpenDX files are written
			by the 8 processors used to perform the
			calculation.  Writing separate OpenDX files
			allows us to avoid communication in the
			parallel run and keeps individual file sizes
			(relatively) small.  Additionally, if a user is
			interested in a specific portion of the problem
			domain, only a few files are needed to get
			local potential information.
		</para>
		<para>
			However, most users are interested in global
			potentials.  For some programs (<ulink
				url="http://opendx.org">OpenDX</ulink>,
			<ulink
				url="http://www.visualdatatools.com/">DataTank</ulink>),
			the individual potential files can simply be
			read into the program separately and the
			program will reconstruct the global map.
			Most other programs will require the user to
			reassemble the global map first; APBS provides
			the <filename><ulink
					url="&ugurl;">mergedx</ulink></filename>
			program for this purpose.
			<filename>mergedx</filename> is a simple
			program that allows users to combine several
			OpenDX files from a parallel focusing
			calculation into a single map.  This map can be
			downsampled from the original resolution to
			provide coarser datasets for fast
			visualization, etc.
			For example, the command
			<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> mergedx 65 65 65 pot0.dx pot1.dx pot2.dx pot3.dx pot4.dx pot5.dx pot6.dx pot7.dx
			</screen>
			will generate a file
			<filename>gridmerged.dx</filename>
			which has downsampled the much larger dataset
			contained in the 8 OpenDX files into a
			65<superscript>3</superscript> file which
			would be suitable for rough visualization.  An
			example of the <filename>mergedx</filename>
			output (see <xref linkend="vmd-isocontour"/>
			for methods) is shown in 
			<figure> <title>Actin dimer isocontours from
parallel focusing</title>
					<graphic fileref="images/actin_dimer-iso_trans.jpg"></graphic>

				Note that downsampling isn't necessary -- and
				often isn't desirable for high quality
				visualization or quantitative analysis.

				to the <literal>ELEC</literal>

			</para>
			<para>
				Scalar maps from asynchronous APBS calculations
				can be combined using the
				<filename>mergedx</filename> program as
