# Virtual Reality capability with APBS and PDB2PQR

## Download Software
APBS tools have been coupled with a virtual reality platform, UnityMol-APBS, to provide a powerful immersive experience to visualize and compare calculated results.

APBS executables must be placed in the users C:/ folder (note: the directory names must not be changed).

## Example
Analysis of the electrostatic surface potentials and electrostatic field lines of *Torpoedo californica* acetylcholinesterase.
PROPKA is an empirical method provided with the PDB2PQR tools. This method uses a heuristic method to compute pKa perturbations due to desolvation, hydrogen bonding, and chargeâ€“charge interactions. Instructions provided for analysis of *Torpoedo californica* acetylcholinesterase can act as a template for other custom uses with APBS tools in UnityMol-APBS:
