APBS 1.4.1 (2014-08)
====================

=================
Summary
=================

We are pleased to announced the release of APBS 1.4.1. This was primarily a bug fix release; however, we have added a few features we'd like to hightlight below.
We would like to also highlight our new website, still located at: http://www.poissonboltzmann.org. This site is also hosted at GitHub and we hope that the new organization will make it easier for people to find the content they need. While we are still in the process of migrating some remaining content, we have added links to the previous page when needed.
Thank you for your continuing support of APBS. As always, please use our mailing list to send up questions or comments about our software.
