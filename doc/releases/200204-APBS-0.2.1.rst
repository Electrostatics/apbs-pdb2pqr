APBS 0.2.1 (2002-04)
====================

This version requires the latest version of MALOC to work properly!

* Syntax changes
    
    * The writepot and writeacc keywords have been generalized and new I/O features have been added.  The syntax is now:
        
        * write pot dx potential
        * write smol dx surface
        * etc.  Please see the User's Manual for more information
        
    * The read keywords has been generalized and new I/O features have been added which support the use of pre-calculated coefficient grids, etc.  The correct syntax for reading in a molecule is now "read mol pqr mol.pqr end"; please see the User's Manual for more information.
    * The "mg" keyword is no longer supported; all input files should use "mg-manual" or one of the other alternatives instead.
    
* A change in the behavior of the "calcenergy" keyword; passing an argument of 2 to this keyword now prints out per-atom energies in addition to the energy component information
* A new option has been added to tools/manip/acc to give per-atom solvent-accessible surface area contributions
* A new option has been added to tools/manip/coulomb to give per-atom electrostatic energies
* Added tools/mesh/dxmath for performing arithmetic on grid-based data (i.e., adding potential results from two calculations, etc.)
* Added tools/mesh/uhbd_asc2bin for converting UHBD-format grid files from ASCII to binary (contributed by Dave Sept)
* Improvement of VMD visualization scripts (contributed by Dave Sept)
* The API has changed significantly; please see the Programmer's Manual.
* Working (but still experimental) Python wrappers for major APBS functions.
* More flexible installation capabilities (pointed out by Steve Bond)
* Added ability to use vendor-supplied BLAS
* Brought up-to-date with new MALOC
