Of course, it also contains a few bug fixes.
Highlights include:

* Changes to the User Manual
* Addition of a Programmer's Manual
* Various FEtk-related things (no particular impact to the user)
* Improvements to the test systems
* Change in the format for printing energies
* Change in directory structure
* Fixed centering bug in main driver (only impacted I/o)
* Fixed error message bug in VPMG class
* Fixed grid length bug (popped up during sanity checks) in VPMG class

* Note that Compaq Tru64 Alpha users may still experience problems while compiling due to some strangess with linking C and FORTRAN objects.
