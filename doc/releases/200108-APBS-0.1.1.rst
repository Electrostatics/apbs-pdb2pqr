APBS 0.1.1 (2001-08)
====================

I am slightly less pleased to announce the first bug-fix for APBS, version 0.1.1.
This fixes compilation problems that popped up for several folks,
including:

* Syntax errors with non-GNU compilers
* Errors in the installation instructions
* Installation of binary in machine-specific directory
