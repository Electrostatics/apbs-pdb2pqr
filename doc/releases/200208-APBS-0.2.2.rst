APBS 0.2.2 (2002-08)
====================   


* There were several other changes along the way... I lost track.
* Changed coordinate indexing in some energy calculations
* Updated documentation to reflect recent changes on Blue Horizon
* Improved speed of problem setup BUT NOW RESTRICT use of input coefficient maps (see documentation)
* Updated documentation, placing particular emphasis on use of Intel compilers and vendor BLAS on Intel Linux systems
* Fixed bug for nonpolar force evaluation in Vpmg_dbnpForce
* Removed MG test scripts; use :file:`bin/*.c` for templates/testing
* Made main driver code completely memory-leak free (i.e., if you wanted to wrap it and call it repeatedly -- Thanks to Robert Konecny)
* Fixed main driver code for compatibility with SGI compilers (Thanks to Fabrice Leclerc)
* Made focused evaluation of forces more sensible.
* Added 'print force' statement
* Fixed bug in OpenDX input/output (OpenDX documentation is lousy!)
