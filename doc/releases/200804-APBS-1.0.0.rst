New features
=====================


* Changed license to New BSD style open source license (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) for more information
* Added in a feature limited version of PMG (Aqua) that reduces the memory footprint of an APBS run by 2-fold
* Modified several routines to boost the speed of APBS calculations by approximately 10% when combined with the low memory version of APBS
* Simplified parameter input for ION and SMPBE keywords (key-value pairs) 
* Examples and documentation for size-modified PBE code (Vincent Chu et al)
* Added in "fast" compile-time option that uses optimized parameters for multigrid calculations
* mg-dummy calculations can be run with any number (n>3) of grid points
* Updated PMG license to LGPL
* Added per-atom SASA information output from APOLAR calculations
* Added per-atom verbosity to APOLAR calculation outputs
* Ability to read-in MCSF-format finite element meshes (e.g., as produced by Holst group GAMER software)
* Updated installation instructions in user guide
* Updated inputgen.py to write out the electrostatic potential for APBS input file.
