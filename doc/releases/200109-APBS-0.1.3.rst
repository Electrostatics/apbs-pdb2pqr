APBS 0.1.3 (2001-09)
====================

This version features a few improvements in scripts, PDB parsing flexibility, and portability, including:

* Dave Sept upgraded the psize and shift scripts to allow more flexibility in PDB formats.
* Chain ID support has been added to the PDB/PQR parser
* Removed -g from compiler flags during linking of C and FORTAN under OSF (thanks to Dagmar Floeck and Julie Mitchell for help debugging this problem)
