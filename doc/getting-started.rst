Getting started
===============

This section gives a basic overview of APBS-PDB2PQR workflows. 
It assumes that you have `registered <http://eepurl.com/by4eQr>`_ and obtained access to the software as described in :doc:`downloads`.

The basic APBS-PDB2PQR workflow involves a few simple steps, illustrated in the figure below and enumerated as:

#. Identify your molecular structure for :ref:`pdb2pqr` by specifying a `PDB ID <http://www.pdb.org>`_ or uploading your own structure.
#. Use :ref:`pdb2pqr` to specify the titration state of the system, repair missing atoms, and assign parameters (charges and radii) to the atoms of your system.
#. Run :ref:`apbs` from within :ref:`pdb2pqr` or via the command line.
#. Visualize the results from within :ref:`pdb2pqr` or via :doc:`/other-software`.
