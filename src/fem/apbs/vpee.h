/** @defgroup Vpee Vpee class
 *  @brief  This class provides some functionality for error esimation
 *          in parallel. 
 * 
 *    This class provides some functionality for error esimation in parallel.
 *    The purpose is to modulate the error returned by some external error
 *    estimator according to the partitioning of the mesh.  For example, the
 *    Bank/Holst parallel refinement routine essentially reduces the error
 *    outside the ``local" partition to zero.  However,  this leads to the need
 *    for a few final overlapping Schwarz solves to smooth out the errors near
 *    partition boundaries.  Supposedly, if the region in which we allow
 *    error-based refinement includes the ``local" partition and an external
 *    buffer zone approximately equal in size to the local region, then the
 *    solution will asymptotically approach the solution obtained via more
 *    typical methods.  This is essentially a more flexible parallel
 *    implementation of MC's AM_markRefine.
