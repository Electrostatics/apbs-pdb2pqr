/** @brief   Screaming linear multilevel method.
 *
 *    algorithm:  linear multigrid iteration (cs)
 *
 *    multigrid v-cycle solver.
 *
 *    input:
 *       (1) fine and coarse grid discrete linear operators: L_h, L_H
 *       (2) fine grid source function: f_h
 *       (3) fine grid approximate solution: u_h
 *
 *    output:
 *       (1) fine grid improved solution: u_h
 *
 *    the two-grid algorithm is:
 *       (1) pre-smooth:               u1_h = smooth(L_h,f_h,u_h)
 *       (2) restrict defect:          d_H  = r(L_h(u1_h) - f_h)
 *       (3) solve for correction:     c_H  = L_H^{-1}(d_H)
 *       (4) prolongate and correct:   u2_h = u1_h - p(c_H)
 *       (5) post-smooth:              u_h  = smooth(L_h,f_h,u2_h)
 *
 *    (of course, c_H is determined with another two-grid algorithm)
 *
 *    implementation notes:
 *       (0) "u1_h" must be kept on each level until "c_H" is computed,
 *           and then both are used to compute "u2_h".
 *       (1) "u_h" (and then "u1_h") on all levels is stored in the "x" array.
 *       (2) "d_H" is identically "f_h" for f_h on the next coarser grid.
 *       (3) "c_h" is identically "u_h" for u_h on the next coarser grid.
 *       (4) "d_H" is stored in the "r" array (must be kept for post-smooth).
 *       (5) "f_h" is stored in the "fc" array.
 *       (6) "L_h" on all levels is stored in the "ac" array.
 *       (7) signs may be reveresed; i.e., residual is used in place
 *           of the defect in places, etc.
