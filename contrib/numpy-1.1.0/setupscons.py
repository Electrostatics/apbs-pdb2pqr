"""NumPy: array processing for numbers, strings, records, and objects.

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for
interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.

There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
basic linear algebra and random number generation.
