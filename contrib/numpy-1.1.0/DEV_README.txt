Thank you for your willingness to help make NumPy the best array system
available.

The only rules we like to follow are to try hard to keep the SVN
repository in a buildable state and to not indiscriminately muck with
what others have contributed.

Simple changes and obvious improvements are always welcome.  Changes
that fundamentally change behavior need discussion on
numpy-discussions@scipy.org before anything is done.


Please add meaningful comments when you check changes in.  These comments
form the basis of the change-log.  Add unit tests to excercise new
code, and regression tests whenever you fix a bug.
