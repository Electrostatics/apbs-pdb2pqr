Description: NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
        efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
        records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
        arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
        introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
        create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for
        interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.
        
        There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
        basic linear algebra and random number generation.
