    APBS uses FETK (the Finite Element ToolKit) to solve the
    Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  FETK is a portable collection
    of finite element modeling class libraries developed by the Michael Holst
    research group and written in an object-oriented form of C.  FEtk is
    designed to solve general coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential
    equations using adaptive finite element methods, inexact Newton methods,
    and algebraic multilevel methods.  More information about FEtk may be found
    at <http://www.FEtk.ORG>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    APBS also uses Aqua to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation numerically.  
    Aqua is a modified form of the Holst group PMG library <http://www.FEtk.ORG>
    which has been modified by Patrice Koehl
    <http://koehllab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/> for improved efficiency and
    memory usage when solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.

        This driver program calculates electrostatic potentials, energies,
        and forces using both multigrid and finite element methods.
        It is invoked as:

        apbs [options] apbs.in

        where apbs.in is a formatted input file and [options] are:

--output-file=<name>     Enables output logging to the path
        listed in <name>.  Uses flat-file
        format is --output-format is not used.
--output-format=<type>   Specifies format for logging.  Options
        for type are either "xml" or "flat".
--help                   Display this help information.

    Options specific to the Opal web client are:

--fetch=<output file location>  Used to specify the location to which the files should be downloaded. Files are downloaded to current directory if <output file location> or the entire flag is omitted when expected.
--job-id=<job ID>        Specifies the job ID of the run for which results are to be downloaded. Expects the '--fetch' flag to be present as well.
--no-fetch               Disables fetching of files following (only) a blocked run.
--non-blocking           Disables blocking and outputs a URL at which
    the data can be retreived later.
--service-location=<URL> Specifies the location of the Opal server. 
    Defaults to http://ws.nbcr.net/opal/services/ApbsOpalService
