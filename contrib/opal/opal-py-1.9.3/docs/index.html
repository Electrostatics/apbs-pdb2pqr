<h1>Python Opal Web Service Client: Version 1.9.3</h1>

<hr/>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>This distribution contains the WSDL for the Opal Web service toolkit,
and a sample Python client that invokes a <a
href="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/">PDB2PQR</a> service that has been
deployed via Opal on our production cluster (ws.nbcr.net). Alternatively,
you could follow the documentation for the server-side installation of Opal
<a href="http://nbcr.net/software/opal/documentation.html">here</a>, and
deploy a PDB2PQR service yourself.

<h2>2. Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The Python client should work on both Unix and Windows platforms as long
as you have the following packages installed.

<ol TYPE="1">
   <li><p>Python 2.3 or higher: Download and install Python from <a
   href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>, if you don't
   have a Python installation on your local machine. Add the Python bin
   directory to your environment variable PATH.</li>
   
   <li><p>ZSI 2.1_a1: ZSI is a SOAP and Web services toolkit for
   Python. Download ZSI from <a
   href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26590&package_id=30660">SourceForge</a>.
   If you are installing on a Unix platform, you would need to use a sudo
   or root shell. Change to the ZSI-2.1-a1/ directory that is extracted from
   the tarball, and execute the following command:
   <TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
   <TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#000000"
   <pre class="SCREEN">
       python setup.py install</pre>
   </FONT></TD></TR>
   </TABLE>

   <p>Note the location where the ZSI package is installed. In particular,
   note the location of the <i>wsdl2py</i> script that we need to use in
   the future. Typically, the packages are installed inside the Python
   installation. On Windows, wsdl2py typically resides inside
   $PYTHON_HOME/scripts, where PYTHON_HOME represents the location of the
   Python installation. On Unix, it is usually inside $PYTHON_HOME/bin.
   Henceforth, we will refer to this location as <i>WSDL2PY_HOME</i>.

   <p><i>Opal will not work with any other version of ZSI. Please ensure
   that you are using ZSI version 2.1-a1.</i>.
</ol>

<h2>3. Installation</h2>

<ol TYPE="1">
<li><p>Download the Python source distribution for installation from <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=211778">here</a>,
if you don't have the appropriate version already.

<p>Expand the tarball that you have downloaded using the GNU tar utility,
as follows:
   <TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
   <TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#000000"
   <pre class="SCREEN">
    tar zxvf opal-py-$VERSION.tar.gz</pre>
   </FONT></TD></TR>
   </TABLE>

<p>This should create a new directory called opal-py-$VERSION/ where all
the sources are expanded. Henceforth, we will call this directory
<i>OPAL_PY_HOME</i>.
</li>

<li><p>Generate the stubs from the WSDL file with the following command inside
the $OPAL_PY_HOME directory:
   <TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
   <TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#000000"
   <pre class="SCREEN">
    $WSDL2PY_HOME/wsdl2py wsdl/opal.wsdl</pre>
   </FONT></TD></TR>
   </TABLE>

<p>This generates two useful files - AppService_client.py and
AppService_types.py. The former contains the stubs required to
communicate with the remote Web service, while the latter contains the
types defined in the WSDL for the service.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Running the Client</h2>

<p>A sample Opal client is shown in $OPAL_PY_HOME/Pdb2pqrClient.py. It shows how to
retrieve a reference to a remote Web service port, set parameters, and
invoke remote operations. To launch the remote PDB2PQR service, the argument
string (<tt>--ff=amber sample.pdb sample.pqr</tt>) and the list of
input files (<tt>etc/sample.pdb</tt>) are sent over. The service returns a
<tt>jobID</tt> that is used later to query for status and retrieve
locations of the output files. Alternatively, the service can also be
invoked in a <em>blocking</em> fashion, where the client blocks until the
remote execution is complete, and the outputs are returned as a response to
the same invocation.

<p>To run the client, you can run the following command from inside the
$OPAL_PY_HOME directory.
   <TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
   <TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#000000"
   <pre class="SCREEN">
    python Pdb2pqrClient.py</pre>
   </FONT></TD></TR>
   </TABLE>

<p>By default, the client uses the Web service running on
http://ws.nbcr.net:8080. To change this location, modify the URL inside
Pdb2pqrClient.py.

<h2>5. Security</h2>

<p>The Opal Web service can be optionally set up to accept connections
using GSI-based HTTPS documentation for instructions). The following
snippet of code from Pdb2pqrClient.py shows how to access a secure Opal
service from Python.

   <TABLE BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0" WIDTH="100%">
   <TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#000000"
   <pre class="SCREEN">
    # set the locations for the X509 certificate and key
    cert = "/Users/sriramkrishnan/certs/apbs_service.cert.pem"
    key = "/Users/sriramkrishnan/certs/apbs_service.privkey"
    ...
	# example of ssl invocation
	appServicePort = appLocator.getAppServicePortType(
	    baseURL + "opal/services/Pdb2pqrServicePort",
	    ssl=1,
     	    transdict=dict(cert_file=cert, key_file=key),
	    transport=httplib.HTTPSConnection)
    ...</pre>
  </FONT></TD></TR>
  </TABLE>

<p>Note that if you are using proxy certificates, they have to be RFC 3820
compliant. This can be done by creating a Grid proxy using
<tt>grid-proxy-init -rfc</tt> (only works for Globus Toolkit 4.0.x). This
has only been tested with OpenSSL version 0.9.7g, and may not work with
older versions.

<h2>6. Feedback</h2>

Sourceforge to report bugs and feature requests, and the NBCR Web Services
User Forum (<a href="https://nbcr.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=13">WSUF</a>)
