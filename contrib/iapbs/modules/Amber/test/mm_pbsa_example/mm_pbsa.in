@DECOMP 
#
# Energy decomposition parameters (this section is only relevant if DC = 1 above)
#
#   Energy decomposition is performed for gasphase energies, desolvation free
#     energies calculated with GB, and nonpolar contributions to desolvation
#     using the LCPO method.
#   For amino acids, decomposition is also performed with respect to backbone 
#     and sidechain atoms.
#
#   DCTYPE - Values of 1 or 2 yield a decomposition on a per-residue basis,
#            values of 3 or 4 yield a decomposition on a pairwise per-residue
#               basis. For the latter, so far the number of pairs must not 
#               exceed the number of residues in the molecule considered.
#            Values 1 or 3 add 1-4 interactions to bond contributions.
#            Values 2 or 4 add 1-4 interactions to either electrostatic or vdW 
#              contributions.
#
#   COMREC - Residues belonging to the receptor molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   COMLIG - Residues belonging to the ligand molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   RECRES - Residues in the receptor molecule.
#   LIGRES - Residues in the ligand molecule.
#   {COM,REC,LIG}PRI - Residues considered for output.
#   {REC,LIG}MAP - Residues in the complex which are equivalent to the residues
#                  in the receptor molecule or the ligand molecule.

@PB
#
# PB parameters (this section is only relevant if PB = 1 above)
#
#   The following parameters are passed to the PB solver.
#   Additional input parameters may also be added here. See the sander PB
#   documentation for more options.
#
#   PROC -  Determines which method is used for solving the PB equation:
#           By default, PROC = 2, the pbsa program of the AMBER suite is used.
#   REFE -  Determines which reference state is taken for PB calc:
#           By default, REFE = 0, reaction field energy is calculated with
#           EXDI/INDI. Here, INDI must agree with DIELC from MM part.
#   INDI -  Dielectric constant for the solute.
#   EXDI -  Dielectric constant for the surrounding solvent.
#   ISTRNG - Ionic strength (in mM) for the Poisson-Boltzmann solvent.
#   PRBRAD - Solvent probe radius in Angstrom:
#           1.4: with the radii in the prmtop files. Default.
#           1.6: with the radii optimized by Tan and Luo (In preparation).
#           See RADIOPT on how to choose a cavity radii set.
#   RADIOPT - Option to set up radii for PB calc:
#           0: uses the radii from the prmtop file. Default.
#           1: uses the radii optimized by Tan and Luo (In preparation)
#           with respect to the reaction field energies computed
#           in the TIP3P explicit solvents. Note that optimized radii
#           are based on AMBER atom types (upper case) and charges.
#           Radii from the prmtop files are used if the atom types
#           are defined by antechamber (lower case).
#   SCALE - Lattice spacing in no. of grids per Angstrom.
#   LINIT - No. of iterations with linear PB equation.
#   IVCAP - If set to 1, a solvent sphere (specified by CUTCAP,XCAP,YCAP, 
#           and ZCAP) is excised from a box of water. If set to 5, a solvent shell
#           is excised, specified by CUTCAP (the thickness of the shell in A).
#           The electrostatic part
#           of the solvation free energy is estimated from a linear response 
#           approximation using the explicit water plus a reaction field
#           contribution from outside the sphere (i.e., a hybrid solvation approach 
#           is pursued). In addition, the nonpolar 
#           contribution is estimated from a sum of (attractive) dispersion 
#           interactions calc. between the solute and the solvent molecules 
#           plus a (repulsive) cavity contribution. For the latter,
#           the surface calculation must be done with MS = 1 and the PROBE should
#           be set to 1.4 to get the solvent excluded surface.
#   CUTCAP - Radius of the water sphere or thickness of the water shell. 
#           Note that the sphere must enclose the whole solute.
#   XCAP  - Location of the center of the water sphere.
#   YCAP
#   ZCAP
#
# NP Parameters for nonpolar solvation energies if MS = 0
#
#   NPOPT - Option for modeling nonpolar solvation free energy.
#           See sander PB documentation for more information on the
#           implementations by Tan and Luo (In preparation).
#           1: uses the solvent-accessible-surface area to correlate total
#           nonpolar solvation free energy:
#           Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF. Default.
#           2: uses the solvent-accessible-surface area to correlate the
#           repulsive (cavity) term only, and uses a surface-integration
#           approach to compute the attractive (dispersion) term:
#           Gnp = Gdisp + Gcavity
#               = Gdisp + SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF.
#           When this option is used, RADIOPT has to be set to 1,
#           i.e. the radii set optimized by Tan and Luo to mimic Gnp
#           in TIP3P explicit solvents. Otherwise, there is no guarantee
#           that Gnp matches that in explicit solvents.
#   SURFTEN/SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar
#           solvation free energy Gnp acccording to NPOPT.
#           If NPOPT = 1 and RADIOPT = 0 (default, see above),
#           use SURFTEN/SURFOFF parameters that fit with the radii from the
#           prmtop file, e.g., use SURFTEN: 0.00542; SURFOFF: 0.92 for PARSE radii. 
#           If NPOPT = 2 and RADIOPT = 1, these two lines
#           can be removed, i.e. use the default values set in pbsa
#           for this nonpolar solvation model. Otherwise, please
#           set these to the following: SURFTEN: 0.04356; OFFSET: -1.008
#
# NP Parameters for nonpolar solvation energies if MS = 1
#
#   SURFTEN/SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar contribution Gnp to
#           the desolvation according to either 
#           (I) Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF (if IVCAP = 0) or
#           (II) Gnp = Gdisp + Gcavity = Gdisp + SURFTEN * SESA + SURFOFF (if IVCAP > 0). 
#           In the case of (I), use parameters that fit with the radii from the
#           reaction field calculation. E.g., use SURFTEN: 0.00542, SURFOFF: 0.92 
#           for PARSE radii or use SURFTEN: 0.005, SURFOFF: 0.86 for Tan & Luo radii.  
#           In the case of (II), use SURFTEN: 0.069; SURFOFF: 0.00 for calculating the
#           Gcavity contribution.
