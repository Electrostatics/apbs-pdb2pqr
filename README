APBS is an adaptive multilevel finite element Poisson-Boltzmann solver for
quantitatively determining the electrostatic properties of biomolecules in
aqueous monovalent salt solutions.  This software uses the MC library for
the adaptive multilevel finite element solution of nonlinear elliptic
partial differential equations.

APBS is written in Michael Holst's Clean-C and can be compiled with either
C or C++ compilers.

Please see doc/ for more information about the APBS software and ./INSTALL
for installation instructions.
