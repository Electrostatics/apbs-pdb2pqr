Installation on most systems is rather straightforward - as the bulk of the 
PDB2PQR code is written in Python, the PDB2PQR code itself is 
architecture/compiler independent. PDB2PQR has been tested using Python 
versions 2.6 through 2.7 - problems will occur with older versions. 

If you would like to enable pdb2pka or ligand support, then you must have Numpy installed.
http://numpy.scipy.org/

PDB2PQR will need to be configured and compiled in order to run:

  $ python scons/scons.py (see python scons/scons.py --help for more options)
  
Configure parameters
  --prefix=DIR                Set install directory. Default is ~/pdb2pqr
  --with-url=URL              Set url for the website.  Default http://<COMPUTER NAME>/pdb2pqr/
  --with-apbs=APBS            Location of APBS install.
  --with-default-opal         Use default URL for Opal service -> http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/opal2/services/pdb2pqr_1.8
  --with-opal=OPAL            Set URL for Opal service
  --with-default-apbs-opal    Use default URL for APBS Opal service -> http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/opal2/services/apbs_1.3
  --with-apbs-opal=APBS_OPAL  Set URL for APBS Opal service.
  --with-max-atoms=MAX_ATOMS  Sets the maximum number of atoms in a protein for non-Opal job submission. Only affects web tools. Default is 10000
  --disable-pdb2pka           Disable pkb2pka compilation. Needed if no C++ compiler is installed or numpy is not installed. pdb2pka is required for ligand support.

This should configure pdb2pqr and compile the pdb2pka wrappers necessary to interface with PDB2PQR.
                                
Installing is only needed if you plan to set up the web service or to make the install available to all users.
        
  $ python scons/scons.py install

pdb2pqr will be configured to use whichever python was used to run the build script.  
If you would like to use a different installed python to run pdb2pqr run the scons/scons.py script with that python. 
For example:

  $ /opt/python27/python scons/scons.py 
  
Numpy must be installed on the python used to build pdb2pqr.
  
Compilation of pdb2pka on Windows requires that mingw32 and msys be installed along with the gcc C++ compiler. Compilation with Visual Studio is not currently supported.
Use MinGW-Get to install mingw. During installation select "C++ Compiler" and "MinGW Developer ToolKit"
http://www.mingw.org/

The current ZSI version for Opal services is ZSI-2.1-a1.

If numpy cannot be installed directly on the python used to run pdb2pqr you can either install numpy for your local user account or use virtualenv.
