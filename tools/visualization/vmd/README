This directory contains tools written by Dave Sept (dsept@biomed.wustl.edu)
which allow users to visualize electrostatic potentials within the VMD
(http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) software package.  These tools require
at least VMD version 1.7.1.

A sample script is provided in loadstuff.vmd, which can be invoked on the
command line by 

  vmd -e loadstuff.vmd

This script needs to be modified to include the correct molecule and potential
file names.  Additional isocontours can be displayed by using commands in the
VMD console, such as "add_contour -2.0 1" to add a red contour at -2.0 kT/e and
"add_contour 2.0 0" to add a blue contour at +2.0 kT/e.
