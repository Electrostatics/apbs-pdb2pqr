README for tools/Python directory

This directory contains Python wrappers for APBS.

Files:
    apbslib.i   - SWIG interface file
    apbslib.c   - SWIG generated C file
    apbslib.py  - SWIG generated Python file containing wrappers
                  for the APBS functions defined in routines.c
    apbslibc.so - Generated shared object file
    main.py     - Driver file for APBS code; mimics main.c
    apbs.in     - Example APBS input file for Born Ion example

To run the Python-wrapper version of APBS, make sure you have a working
version of Python installed.  By default, the wrappers are compiled during the 
initial configure process if Python is detected on the system.*  Type

python main.py <input file>

to run APBS on an input file in Python.  The input file must be the same
format as the standard APBS input files - see documentation for formatting.


* The main configure script needs additional libraries to compile correctly,
and thus may not work on all systems.  Current status:

Linux       - Working
Irix/SGI    - Support built in, untested
Sun/Solaris - Support built in, untested
Cygwin      - No support (by default, the directory is not compiled)

If you are using Windows/Cygwin, it is suggested that you modify the Makefile to change all .so objects to .dll, and to add the path to libpython2.X.dll.a (where X is the python version) to PY_LDEXTRA .
