README for tools/Python directory
---------------------------------

This directory contains Python wrappers for APBS.

Files:
    apbslib.i   - SWIG interface file
    apbslib.c   - SWIG generated C file
    apbslib.py  - SWIG generated Python file containing wrappers
                  for the APBS functions defined in routines.c
    apbslibc.so - Generated shared object file
    main.py     - Driver file for APBS code; mimics main.c

To run the Python-wrapper version of APBS, make sure you have a working
version of Python installed.  The wrappers are compiled during the 
initial installation process.  Type

python main.py <input file>

to run APBS on an input file in Python.  The input file must be the same
format as the standard APBS input files - see documentation for formatting.
