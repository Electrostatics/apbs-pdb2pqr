                     Clique Algorithms

  Included in this distribution are two methods to find cliques in a
graph.  One is the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, as implemented from the
description in Algorithm 457 from the Algorithms from the
Communications of the ACM (available online via netlib at
http://www.netlib.org/tomspdf/457.pdf).  The other is the public
domain dfmax.c code available as part of the DIMACS challenge, and
available at ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/challenge/graph/solvers/ .

  Both algorithms have been modified to work better as C library
functions.  Changes include making arrays start at 0 instead of 1,
standardizing the function interface, adding callback support for
notification of each newly found clique, and support for the callbacks
to terminate the search early, if needed.

  The software is being made available under the GNU LGPL.  A copy of
that license is available in the file COPYING.

  As stands, the code is not very useful since there are no drivers
for it except a small test harness.  You will have to write an adapter
to get it working with whatever data you might have.

  To get the test harness working, type `make'.  The code is all
standard C and should be runnable anywhere.
