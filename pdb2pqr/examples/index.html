		<p> This page provides some very basic examples on the features
		of PDB2PQR.  It is under continual development and <a

		are appreciated! </p>

		<h2>Basic PDB file operations</h2>

		<p>This section outlines the basic process of adding hydrogens
		and assigning charge/radius parameters to an otherwise complete
		PDB structure.</p>

		<h3>Fasciculin-1 (<a
				href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1FAS">1FAS</a>)
		</h3>
		<p>  This 3-finger toxin structure is <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1FAS">available</a> at high
		resolution (1.9 &Aring;) and has all its heavy atoms present in
		the PDB file.  We'll use one of the <a
			href="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/#availability">PDB2PQR
			servers</a> to add hydrogens to this protein and
		optimize their positions. </p>
		<ol>
			<li> From the PDB2PQR server web page, enter
			<code>1FAS</code> into the PDB ID field. </li>
			<li> Choose whichever forcefield and naming schemes you
			prefer. </li>
			<li> Under options, be sure the "Ensure that new atoms
			are not rebuilt too close to existing atoms" and
			"Optimize the hydrogen bonding network" options are
			selected.  You can select other options as well, if
			interested. </li>
			<li> Hit the "Submit" button. </li>
		</ol>
		<p> Once the calculations are complete, you should get a web
		page with a link to the new PQR file.  You can download this
		PQR file and view it in your favorite molecular visualization
		package (e.g., <a
			href=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>, <a
			href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMOL</a>, or <a
			href="http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner/python/pmv/index.html">PMV</a>).
		For comparison, you might download the <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1FAS">the
			original PDB file</a> and compare the PDB2PQR-generated
		structure with the original to see where hydrogens were placed.
		</p>

		<h3>Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (<a
				href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1A06">1A06</a>)</h3>


		<p> This kinase structure is <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1A06">available
		</a> at somewhat lower (2.5 &Aring;) resolution and is missing
		several sidechain atoms as well as portions of its sequence.
		We'll use this example to demonstrate how PDB2PQR <i>can</i>
		add missing sidechain atoms to an imcomplete structure but
		<i>cannot</i> fill in missing regions of the backbone.  In
		particular, we'll use PDB2PQR to add/optimize hydrogens,
		reconstruct sidechains K53, N65, R140, E154, Q192, Y195, E221,
		N222, K225, E228, K232, and Q272 from model geometries, and
		assign parameters.
		<ol>
			<li> From the PDB2PQR server web page, enter
			<code>1A06</code> into the PDB ID field. </li>
			<li> Choose whichever forcefield and naming schemes you
			prefer. </li>
			<li> Under options, be sure the "Ensure that new atoms
			are not rebuilt too close to existing atoms" and
			"Optimize the hydrogen bonding network" options are
			selected.  You can select other options as well, if
			interested. </li>
			<li> Hit the "Submit" button. </li>
		</ol>
		<p> Once the calculations are complete, you should see a web
		page with a link to the new PQR file and warnings about
		incomplete and poorly-positioned portions of the PQR structure.
		In particular, PDB2PQR will complain about missing regions
		between K53 and E64 and between F163 and P182.  PDB2PQR may
		also complain "Unable to debump VAL A 189", referring to bad
		contacts between V189 and other residues that it was unable to
		resolve.  You can download the resulting PQR file and view it
		in your favorite molecular visualization package (e.g., <a
			href=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>, <a
			href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMOL</a>, or <a
			href="http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner/python/pmv/index.html">PMV</a>).
		For comparison, you might download the <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1A06">the
			original PDB file</a> and compare the PDB2PQR-generated
		structure with the original to see where hydrogens were placed.

		<h2>Assigning titration states with <a
				href="http://propka.ki.ku.dk/">PROPKA</a></h2>

		<p>Interested users should read <a
			href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.20660">Li
			H, Robertson AD, Jensen JH. Very Fast Empirical
			Prediction and Rationalization of Protein pKa
			Values. <i>Proteins</i>, <b>61</b>, 704-721
			(2005).</a> for a much more complete
		description and analysis of titration state assignment
		using <a href="http://propka.ki.ku.dk/">PROPKA</a>.  The
		examples here are taken from this paper.  Nearly all of these
		examples can be reproduced using PDB2PQR/PROPKA, we give a
		single example here for demonstration purposes.</p>

		<h3>HIV-1 protease (<a
				href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1HPX">1HPX</a>)</h3>
		<a name="hiv1pka"></a>

		<p> The PDB structure <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1HPX">1HPX</a>
		includes HIV-1 protease complexed with an inhibitor at 2.0
		&Aring; resolution.  HIV-1 protease has two chains; residue D25
		is anionic on one chain and neutral on the other -- these
		titration states are important in the role of D25 as an acid in
		the catalytic mechanism. </p>
		<ol>
			<li> From the PDB2PQR server web page, enter
			<code>1HPX</code> into the PDB ID field. </li>
			<li> Choose whichever forcefield and naming schemes you
			prefer. </li>
			<li> Under options, be sure the "Ensure that new atoms
			are not rebuilt too close to existing atoms",
			"Optimize the hydrogen bonding network", and "Use
			PROPKA to assign protonation states at pH" options are
			selected.  Choose pH 7 for your initial calculations.
			You can select other options as well, if interested.
			</li>
			<li> Hit the "Submit" button. </li>
		</ol>
		<p> Once the calculations are complete, you should see a web
		page with a link to the PROPKA output, a new PQR file, and warnings about
		the ligand KNI (since we didn't choose to parameterize it in
		this calculation -- see <a href="#hiv1lig">below</a>).
		You can download the resulting PQR file and view it
		in your favorite molecular visualization package (e.g., <a
			href=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>, <a
			href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMOL</a>, or <a
			href="http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner/python/pmv/index.html">PMV</a>).
		For comparison, you might download the <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1HPX">the
			original PDB file</a> and compare the PDB2PQR-generated
		structure with the original to see where hydrogens were placed.

		<h2>Ligand parameterization</h2>

		<p>This section outlines the parameterization of ligands using
		the PEOE_PB methods (see <a
			href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.21110">Czodrowski P,
			Dramburg I, Sotriffer CA, Klebe G.  Development, validation,
			and application of adapted peoe charges to estimate pka values
			of functional groups in protein-ligand complexes.
			<i>Proteins</i>.  <b>65</b> (2), 424-37, 2006</a> for more
		information).</p>  As described in the <a
			href="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/userguide.html">PDB2PQR
			user guide</a> and on the <a
			href="http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/server.html">PDB2PQR
			server page</a>, ligand parameterization currently
		requires a MOL2-format representation of the ligand to provide
		the necessary bonding information.  MOL2-format files can be
		obtained through the free 
		<a
			href="http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/">PRODRG
			web server</a> or some molecular modeling software
		packages.</p>

		<h3>HIV-1 protease (<a
				href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1HPX">1HPX</a>)</h3>

		<a name="hiv1lig"> </a>

		<p>Mixing things up a little bit from <a
			href="#hiv1pka">above</a>, we're now ready to look at the <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1HPX">1HPV</a>
		crystal structure (HIV-1 protease) and parameterize its ligand,
		KNI-272.

			<code>1HPX</code> into the PDB ID field. </li>
			<li> Choose whichever forcefield and naming schemes you
			prefer. </li>
			<li> Under options, be sure the "Ensure that new atoms
			are not rebuilt too close to existing atoms",
			"Optimize the hydrogen bonding network", and "Assign
			charges to the ligand specified in a MOL2 file" options
			are
			selected.  The necessary MOL2 file can be downloaded <a
				href="ligands/LIG_1HPX.mol2">here</a>.
			You can select other options as well, if interested.
			</li>
			<li> Hit the "Submit" button. </li>
		</ol>
		<p> Once the calculations are complete, you should see a web
		page with a link to the new PQR file with a  warning about
		debumping P81 (but no warnings about ligand parameterization!).
		You can download the resulting PQR file and view it
		in your favorite molecular visualization package (e.g., <a
			href=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>, <a
			href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net/">PyMOL</a>, or <a
			href="http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner/python/pmv/index.html">PMV</a>).
		For comparison, you might download the <a
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1HPX">the
			original PDB file</a> and compare the PDB2PQR-generated
		structure with the original to see where hydrogens were placed
		and how the ligand is bound to the active site.

		<h3>L-Arabinose binding protein (<a
				href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1ABF">1ABF</a>)</h3>

		<p>Our next example uses PDB structure <a 
			href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1ABF">1ABF</a>
		of L-arabinose binding protein in complex with a sugar ligand
		at 1.90 &Aring; resolution.  To parameterize both this protein
		and its ligand:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li> From the PDB2PQR server web page, enter
			<code>1ABF</code> into the PDB ID field. </li>
			<li> Choose whichever forcefield and naming schemes you
			prefer. </li>
			<li> Under options, be sure the "Ensure that new atoms
			are not rebuilt too close to existing atoms",
			"Optimize the hydrogen bonding network", and "Assign
			charges to the ligand specified in a MOL2 file" options
			are
			selected.  The necessary MOL2 file can be downloaded <a
				href="ligands/LIG_1ABF.mol2">here</a>.
			You can select other options as well, if interested.
			</li>
			<li> Hit the "Submit" button. </li>
		</ol>
		<p> Once the calculations are complete, you should see a web
		page with a link to the new PQR file with a  warning about
		debumping P66, K295, and K306 (but no warnings about ligand
		parameterization!).  You can download the resulting PQR file
		and view it in your favorite molecular visualization package
		(e.g., <a href=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">VMD</a>,
