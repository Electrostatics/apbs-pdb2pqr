These tests are in the process of being incorporated in pyunit.  Not
all errors are currently being caught by pyunit, so it is still
necessary to check the output of the code by hand.

Two top level modules have been provided to run the tests.  Use
"test_zsi.py" to run all of the local tests, or "test_zsi_net.py" to
run all of the zsi tests including those that require network access.

Additional tests are located in the wsdl2py/ directory; see the README
there for more information on those.
