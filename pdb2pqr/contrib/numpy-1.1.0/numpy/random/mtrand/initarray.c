/* These function have been adapted from Python 2.4.1's _randommodule.c

  The following changes have been made to it in 2005 by Robert Kern:

    * init_by_array has been declared extern, has a void return, and uses the
      rk_state structure to hold its data.

   The original file has the following verbatim comments: 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   The code in this module was based on a download from:
	  http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/MT2002/emt19937ar.html

   It was modified in 2002 by Raymond Hettinger as follows:

	* the principal computational lines untouched except for tabbing.

	* renamed genrand_res53() to random_random() and wrapped
	  in python calling/return code.

	* genrand_int32() and the helper functions, init_genrand()
	  and init_by_array(), were declared static, wrapped in
	  Python calling/return code.  also, their global data
	  references were replaced with structure references.

	* unused functions from the original were deleted.
	  new, original C python code was added to implement the
	  Random() interface.

   The following are the verbatim comments from the original code:

   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
   or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
