Installation on most systems is rather straightforward - as the bulk of the 
PDB2PQR code is written in Python, the PDB2PQR code itself is 
architecture/compiler independent. PDB2PQR has been tested using Python 
versions 2.2 through 2.4 - problems may occur with older versions. The PropKa 
code, however, is written in Fortran - and thus to use it with PDB2PQR a 
two step installation is necessary, making use of available C and Fortran 
compilers:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

This should compile the PropKa wrappers necessary to interface with PDB2PQR.

To install PDB2PQR without propka support, use the --disable-propka flag:

    $ ./configure --disable-propka 

This will ensure that Python has been found on your system and will set a 
few global constants.

Please see the main documentation at doc/userguide.html for a complete
look at installation, compiler/architecture support, and a general FAQ.
