Two top level modules have been provided to run the tests. "test_wstools.py"
is used to run all of the local tests. "test_wstools_net.py" is used to run
all of the tests that require network access.

Add the -v option for more informative feedback.

ADDING TESTS:
    1. For Stand-Alone tests add WSDL FILE to appropriate archive file
        Need to add a NEW Archive?:
            config.txt [files] "archive" -- tuple of all archive files, 
            if you need to create a new archive append the archive 
            name to the 'archive' tuple.

    2. Edit config.txt section(s):
        option -- name by which service will be referenced in test case.
            Need an entry under appropriate section(s), this name
            must be unique within each section it appears but it may 
            appear in multiple sections.

        config.txt "test" sections:
          Stand-Alone --  add "option" under [services_by_file]
		eg. amazon = exports/AmazonWebServices.wsdl

          Network -- add "option" under [services_by_http]
		eg. amazon = http://soap.amazon.com/schemas/AmazonWebServices.wsdl

          Broken -- add "option" under [broken]

    3. Done
