BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 1.0.0       8-23-05
#############################################################################
This is the initial version of the PDB2PQR conversion utility.  There are 
several changes to the various "non-official" versions previously available:
    * SourceForge has been chosen as a centralized location for all
      things related to PDB2PQR, including downloads, mailing lists,
      and bug reports.
    * Several additions to the code have been made, including pKa support
      via PropKa, a new hydrogen optimization algorithm which should 
      increase both accuracy and speed, and general bug fixes.

We plan on continuing to improve PDB2PQR by refining the code, adding more
advanced options, and encouraging collaborations with other utilities.

Thank you for your time and interest in the PDB2PQR software.
