BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 1.4.1       6-9-09
#############################################################################
 - NEW FEATURES
  * Disabled Typemap output by default, added --typemap flag to create typemap
    output if needed.
  * Enabled "Create APBS Input File" by default on the web server, so that 
    APBS calculation and visualization are more obvious to the users.
  * Added warnings to stderr and the REMARK field in the output PQR file 
    regarding multiple occupancy entries in PDB file.
  * Added more informative messages in REMARK field, explaining why PDB2PQR
    was unable to assign charges to certain atoms.
  * Updated structures.py, now PDB2PQR keeps the insertion codes from PDB 
    files.
  * Added "make test-long", which runs PDB2PQR on a long list (249) of PDBs
    by default, it is also possible to let it run on specified number of 
    PDBs, e.g.,  export TESTNUM=50; make test-long . 
  * Updated NBCR opal service urls from http://ws.nbcr.net/opal/... to 
    http://ws.nbcr.net/opal2/...
  * Compressed APBS OpenDX output files in zip format, so that users can 
    download zip files from the web server.

 - BUG FIXES
  * Added -fno-stack-protector to CXXFLAGS in configure. This fixes the stack
    smashing problem in simple test on Ubuntu Linux with recent gcc versions.
  * Verbosity outputs should be stdouts, not stderrs in web server interface. 
    Corrected this in src/routines.py.
  * Fixed a bug in psize.py: for a pqr file with no ATOM entries but only 
    HETATM entries in it, inputgen.py should still create an APBS input file
    with reasonable grid lengths. 
  * Added special handling for special mol2 formats (unwanted white spaces
    or blank lines in ATOM or BOND records).
  * Added template file to doc directory, which fixed a broken link in 
    programmer guide.

#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 1.3.0       1-8-08
#############################################################################
 - NEW FEATURES / CHANGES
  * Added "make test" and "make adv-test"
  * Fixed problems with "make dist"
  * Added integration with Opal for launching jobs as well as querying status
  * The user may use NUMPY to specify the location of NUMPY.
  * Both PDB2PKA and PROPKA are enabled by default.  PDB2PKA is enabled by
    default since ligand parameterization would fail without this option.
  * For a regular user, "make install" tells the user the exact command the
    system administrator will use to make the URL viewable.
  * The default value of 7.00 for the pH on the server form is removed due
    to a problem with browser refershing.
  * Updated warning messages for lines beginning with SITE, TURN, SSBOND and 
    LINK.
  * Switched license from GPL to BSD.
  * Made a new tar ball pdb2pqr-1.3.0-1.tar.gz for Windows users who cannot 
    create pdb2pqr.py through configure process.

 - INFRASTRUCTURE
  * configure now automatically detects SRCPATH, WEBSITE, and the location
    of pdb2pqr.cgi.  In version 1.2.1, LOCALPATH(SRCPATH) and WEBSITE were
    defined in src/server.py and the location of pdb2pqr.cgi was specified
    in html/server.html (index.html).  Configure now uses variable 
    substitution with new files src/server.py.in and html/server.html.in to
    create src/server.py and html/server.html (index.html).
  * SRCPATH is automatically set to the current working directory. WEBSITE
    is automatically set to http://fully_qualified_domain_name/pdb2pqr.
    Path to CGI is automcailly set to 
    http://fully_qualified_domain_name/pdb2pqr/pdb2pqr.cgi.  
  * In version 1.2.1, there were 3 variables that needed to be changed to set
    up a server at a location different from agave.wustl.edu.  LOCALPATH,
    WEBSITE, and the location of the CGI file.  In this version, LOCALPATH
    has been used to SRCPATH to avoid confusion, since LOCALPATH could be
    interpreted as the local path for source files or the localpath for the
    server.
  * Since configure now automatically sets the locations of files/directories
    based on the machine and configure options, the default 
    agave.wustl.edu locations are not used anymore.
  * A copy of pdb2pqr.css is included.
  * Configure prints out information about parameters such as python flags,
    srcpath, localpath, website, etc.
  * configure now automatically creates tmp/ with r + w + x permissions.
  * configure now automatically copies pdb2pqr.py to pdb2pqr.cgi.
  * configure now automatically copies html/server.html to index.html after
    variable substitution.  In src/server.py.in (src/server.py), WEBNAME is
    changed to index.html.	
  * ${HOME}/pdb2pqr is the default prefix for a regular user
  * /var/www/html is the default prefix for root
  * http://FQDN/pdb2pqr as default website. 	
  * "make install" runs "make" first, and the copies the approprite files
    to --prefix.
  * If root did not specify --prefix and /var/www/html/pdb2pqr already
    exists, then a warning is issued, and the user may choose to quit or 
    overwrite that directory.	 
  * Similary, if a regular user did not specify --prefix and ${HOME}/pdb2pqr
    already exists, then a warning is issued, and the user may choose to quit
    or overwrite that directory.	
  * If root does not specify --prefix to be a directory to be inside
    /var/www/html (for example, --prefix=/share/apps/pdb2pqr), then a symbolic
    link will be made to /var/www/html/pdb2pqr during "make install".
  * Configure option --with-url can be specified either as something like
    http://sandstone.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr-test or
    sandstone.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr-test.  It also doesn't matter if there's a '/'
    at the end.
  * If user is root, and the last part of URL and prefix are different, for
    example, --with-url=athena.nbcr.net/test0
    --prefix=/var/www/html/pdb2pqr-test, then a warning will be issued saying
    the server will be viewable from the URL specified, but not the URL based
    on pdb2pqr-test.  In other words, the server will be viewable from
    athena.abcr.net/test0, but not athena.nbcr.net/pdb2pqr-test.  During "make
    install", a symbolic link is created to enable users to view the server
    from --with-url.
  * When making a symbolic link for root, if then link destination already
    exists as a directory or a symoblic link, then the user may choose to
    continue with creating the link and overwrite the original directory or quit.
  * If the user changes py_path when running configure for PDB2PQR, then 
    the change also applies to PROPKA.

 - BUG FIXES
  * Fixed the line feed bug. Now PDB2PQR handles different input files (.pdb and
    .mol2) created or saved on different platforms.
  * Fixed "hbondwhatif" warning at start up.

 - KNOWN BUGS
   * The install directory name cannot contain dots.
   * For python 2.2, if PDB2PQR cannot find module sets, then sets needs to 
     be copied from .../python2.2/site-packages/MYSQLdb/sets.py to .../lib/python2.2

#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 1.1.0       4-12-06
#############################################################################
  - NEW FEATURES
    * Structural data files have been moved to XML format.  This should make 
      it easier for users and developers to contribute to the project.
    * Added an extensions directory for small scripts.  Scripts in this 
      directory will be automatically loaded into PDB2PQR has command line
      options for post-processing, and can be easily customized.
    * Code has been greatly cleaned so as to minimize values hard-coded
      into functions and to allow greater customizability via external
      XML files.  This includes a more object-oriented hierarchy of
      structures.
    * Improved detection of the termini of chains.
    * Assign-only now does just that - only assigns parameters to atoms
      without additions, debumping, or optimizations.
    * Added a --clean command line option which does no additions,
      optimizations, or forcefield assignment, but simply aligns the PDB
      columns on output.  Useful for using post-processing scripts like
      those in the extensions directory without modifying the original input
      file.
    * The --userff flag has been replaced by opening up the --ff option
      to user-defined files.
    * Pydoc documentation is now included in html/pydoc.
    * A programmer's guide has been included to explain programming decisions
      and ease future development.
    * A --ffout flag has been added to allow users to output a PQR file in
      the naming scheme of the desired forcefield.
    * User guide FAQ updated.
    * The efficiency of the hydrogen bonding detection script (--hbond) has 
      been greatly improved. 
    * Increased the number of options available to users via the PDB2PQR
      web server.
  - BUG FIXES
    * Updated psize.py to use centers and radii when calculating grid sizes
      (thanks to John Mongan)
    * Fixed bug where PDB2PQR could not read PropKa results from chains with
      more than 1000 residues (thanks to Michael Widmann)
#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 1.0.2       12-15-05
#############################################################################
  - NEW FEATURES
    * Added ability for users to add their own forcefield files.  This
      should be particularly useful for HETATMs.
    * Added sdens keyword to inputgen.py to make PDB2PQR compatibile with
      APBS 0.4.0.
    * Added a new examples directory with a basic runthrough on how to use
      the various features in PDB2PQR.
  - BUG FIXES 
    * Fixed a bug that was unable to handle N-Terminal PRO residues with
      hydrogens already present.
    * Fixed two instances in the PropKa routines where warnings were 
      improperly handled due to a misspelling.
    * Fixed instance where chain IDs were unable to be assigned to proteins
      with more than 26 chains.

BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 1.0.0       8-23-05
#############################################################################
This is the initial version of the PDB2PQR conversion utility.  There are 
several changes to the various "non-official" versions previously available:
    * SourceForge has been chosen as a centralized location for all
      things related to PDB2PQR, including downloads, mailing lists,
      and bug reports.
    * Several additions to the code have been made, including pKa support
      via PropKa, a new hydrogen optimization algorithm which should 
      increase both accuracy and speed, and general bug fixes.

We plan on continuing to improve PDB2PQR by refining the code, adding more
advanced options, and encouraging collaborations with other utilities.

Thank you for your time and interest in the PDB2PQR software.
