README for PDB2PQR 0.1.0

PDB2PQR allows a user to convert a standard PDB file to a PQR file using 
the AMBER, CHARMM ,or PARSE forcefields. PDB2PQR automates many of the common 
tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, 
including: adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular 
structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules in a 
manner consistent with favorable hydrogen-bonding, assigning charge and radius 
parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating PQR output.

A PDB2PQR web server and help page is available at

Usage: 
    
    pdb2pqr.py [options] --ff=<forcefield> <path> [output-path]
    
    Required Arguments:
        <path>        :  The path to the PDB file or an ID
                         to obtain from the PDB archive
        <forcefield>  :  The forcefield to use - currently
                         amber, charmm, and parse are supported.
    Optional Arguments:
        --verbose (-v):  Print additional information to stdout
        --help    (-h):  Display the usage information
        --nodebump    :  Do not perform the debumping operation
        --nohdebump   :  Do not perform hydrogen debumping
        --nohopt      :  Do not perform hydrogen optimization
        --nowatopt    :  Do not perform water optimization
        --hbond       :  Print a list of all hydrogen bonds

    If no output-path is specified, the PQR file is printed to stdout

Notes:

    PDB2PQR currently supports all amino and nucleic acid residues but
    not HETATM residues.  All HETATMs are ignored and omitted from the 
    final PQR file and will need to be readded if desired.
