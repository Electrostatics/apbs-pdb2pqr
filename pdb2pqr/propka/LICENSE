PROPKA USER LICENSE AGREEMENT


With regard to the protein pKa prediction code PROPKA I agree to the following 
conditions: 

I will not supply a copy of the code to anyone outside my institution or 
corporation for any reason whatsoever.  Instead, I will refer any requests for 
copies of the program to the Quantum Chemistry Group at the University of Iowa 
(QCGUI).  This in no way limits my making of copies of the code for backup 
purposes, or for running on more than one computer system at my institution or 
home. 

I understand that copyright or ownership rights to PROPKA are retained by the 
QCGUI and contributors to the PROPKA package.  I will not incorporate any part 
of PROPKA into any other program system, either for sale or for non-profit 
distribution, without written permission from the QCGUI,

I understand that no large program such as PROPKA can be considered to be bug 
free, and accordingly QCGUI supplies the PROPKA software on an "as is" basis, 
with no additional responsibility or liability, 

If results obtained with PROPKA are published in the scientific literature, I 
will reference the program as "Hui Li, Andrew. D. Robertson, and Jan H. Jensen,
Fast Prediction and Rationalization of Protein pKa Values, manuscript in 
preparation"

This license is considered a "Research Group" license. Thus anyone directly 
associated with your research group is covered by the license and may share 
your copy of PROPKA on all of your group's computer resources.
