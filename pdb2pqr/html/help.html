This page is designed to give more information and answer questions related to the PDB2PQR server. <P>
<h3>PDB and PQR File Format</h3>
<P>
The PDB2PQR server parses PDB files that are formatted in standard <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/info.html#File_Formats_and_Standards">PDB format</a>.  At this time, whitespace delimited PDB files are not fully supported and may yield unexpected results.  On output, the PQR file is also column-formatted, but with the <code>altLoc</code>, <code>iCode</code>, and <code>chainID</code> fields removed - thus allowing the PQR file to be visualized with either column-parsing standard molecular graphics programs or software (like <a href="http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/doc/html/user-guide/a2431.html#pqr-format">APBS</a>) that uses whitespace-delimited parsing.

<h3>Algorithm Descriptions</h3>
<P>
The PDB2PQR server allows for two optional algorithms:<P>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that new heavy/hydrogen atoms are not rebuilt too close to existing atoms<P>
This routine will debump reconstructed atoms, ensuring that they are not being placed within the Van der Waals radii of other nearby atoms.  This procedure is carried out by varying the sidechain &Chi; angle until the steric conflict is resolved.<P>
<li>Optimize the hydrogen network<P>
This routine uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to optimize the global hydrogen bonding network in the protein.  As a result of this optimization, the phase of HIS, ASN, and GLN sidechain &Chi; angles are checked for optimum hydrogen-bonding conformation.  Additionally, the routine assigns protonation states to HIS, ASP, and GLU based on optimum hydrogen bonding, local energetics, and model pK<sub>a</sub> values.  Due to the nature of the algorithm, hydrogen optimization is the rate-limiting step of the PDB2PQR server, and should be used cautiously for larger PDB files.<P>
</ul>
