			<h1>PDB2PQR</h1>
			<h3>An automated pipeline for the setup, execution, and analysis of Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics calculations.</h3>
		</center>
		<HR>

		<p> PDB2PQR is a Python software package that automates many of the
		common tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics
		calculations, providing a platform-independent utility for converting
		protein files in <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">PDB format</a> to
		PQR format.  These tasks include:
		<ul>
			<li> Adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to
			biomolecular structures
			<li> Determining side-chain pKas 
			<li> Placing missing hydrogens
			<li> Optimizing the protein for favorable hydrogen bonding
			<li> Assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of
			force fields 
		</ul>

		<p> PDB2PQR was ported to Python by Todd Dolinsky while working with <a
			href="http://agave.wustl.edu">Nathan Baker</a> at Washington
		University in St. Louis.  The PDB2PQR code is based on C++ design and
		algorithms by <a href="http://enzyme.ucd.ie/">Jens Erik Nielsen</a>.
		PDB2PQR was originally designed to facilitate structure preparation for
		<a href="http://apbs.sourceforge.net">APBS</a>.

		<p> PDB2PQR uses <a href="http://propka.ki.ku.dk">PROPKA</a> to
		determine protein pKa values.  PROPKA is developed by the <a
			href="http://propka.ki.ku.dk/~jhjensen/">Jensen Research
			Group</a> at the University of Copenhagen.  More information
		about PROPKA can be found at <a
			href="http://propka.ki.ku.dk/">http://propka.ki.ku.dk/</a>.<P>

		<p> PEOE_PB charges for 
		<!--biomolecue and -->
		ligand parameterization were
		developed by Paul Czodrowski in the <a
			href="http://www.agklebe.de">Klebe Group</a> at the Philipps University Marburg.
