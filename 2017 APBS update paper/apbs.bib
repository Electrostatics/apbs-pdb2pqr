  abstract      = {Here, we give an overview of the small molecule hydration portion of the SAMPL4 challenge, which focused on predicting hydration free energies for a series of 47 small molecules. These gas-to-water transfer free energies have in the past proven a valuable test of a variety of computational methods and force fields. Here, in contrast to some previous SAMPL challenges, we find a relatively wide range of methods perform quite well on this test set, with RMS errors in the 1.2 kcal/mol range for several of the best performing methods. Top-performers included a quantum mechanical approach with continuum solvent models and functional group corrections, alchemical molecular dynamics simulations with a classical all-atom force field, and a single-conformation Poisson-Boltzmann approach. While 1.2 kcal/mol is still a significant error, experimental hydration free energies covered a range of nearly 20 kcal/mol, so methods typically showed substantial predictive power. Here, a substantial new focus was on evaluation of error estimates, as predicting when a computational prediction is reliable versus unreliable has considerable practical value. We found, however, that in many cases errors are substantially underestimated, and that typically little effort has been invested in estimating likely error. We believe this is an important area for further research.},

The expertise of the participants comprised database development, data management, and hands-on experience in the development of data communication standards. The workshop's outcomes are set to help formalize the proposed Investigation, Study, Assay (ISA)-TAB tab-delimited format for representing and communicating experimental metadata.

  abstract      = {pK(A) in proteins are determined by electrostatic energy computations using a small number of optimized protein conformations derived from crystal structures. In these protein conformations hydrogen positions and geometries of salt bridges on the protein surface were determined self-consistently with the protonation pattern at three pHs (low, ambient, and high). Considering salt bridges at protein surfaces is most relevant, since they open at low and high pH. In the absence of these conformational changes, computed pK(A)(comp) of acidic (basic) groups in salt bridges underestimate (overestimate) experimental pK(A)(exp), dramatically. The pK(A)(comp) for 15 different proteins with 185 known pK(A)(exp) yield an RMSD of 1.12, comparable with two other methods. One of these methods is fully empirical with many adjustable parameters. The other is also based on electrostatic energy computations using many non-optimized side chain conformers but employs larger dielectric constants at short distances of charge pairs that diminish their electrostatic interactions. These empirical corrections that account implicitly for additional conformational flexibility were needed to describe the energetics of salt bridges appropriately. This is not needed in the present approach. The RMSD of the present approach improves if one considers only strongly shifted pK(A)(exp) in contrast to the other methods under these conditions. Our method allows interpreting pK(A)(comp) in terms of pH dependent hydrogen bonding pattern and salt bridge geometries. A web service is provided to perform pK(A) computations.},

Chimera is segmented into a core that provides basic services and visualization, and extensions that provide most higher level functionality. This architecture ensures that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate new features. Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.},

Many scientists must also wade through black-box code to interface computational algorithms from diverse sources to supplement their bench work. To reduce these barriers we have developed an open-source plug-in, embedded Python Molecular Viewer (ePMV), that runs molecular modeling software directly inside of professional 3D animation applications (hosts) to provide simultaneous access to the capabilities of these newly connected systems. Uniting host and scientific algorithms into a single interface allows users from varied backgrounds to assemble professional quality visuals and to perform computational experiments with relative ease. By enabling easy exchange of algorithms, ePMV can facilitate interdisciplinary research, smooth communication between broadly diverse specialties, and provide a common platform to frame and visualize the increasingly detailed intersection(s) of cellular and molecular biology.},

We have carried out MD simulations followed by MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) free energy calculations on all the experimentally observed three-quartet intramolecular human telomeric GQ topologies. We also studied antiparallel GQ models with alternative syn-anti patterns of the G-quartets. We tested different ions, dihedral variants of the DNA force field, water models, and simulation lengths. In total, ~35 �s of simulations have been carried out. The systems studied here are considerably more complete than the previously analyzed two-quartet stems. Among other effects, our computations included the stem-loop coupling and ion-ion interactions inside the stem. The calculations showed a broad agreement with the earlier predictions. However, the increase in the completeness of the system was associated with increased noise of the free energy data which could be related, for example, to the presence of long-lived loop substates and rather complex dynamics for the two bound ions inside the G-stem. As a result, the MM-PBSA data were noisy and we could not improve their quantitative convergence even by expanding the simulations to 2.5 �s long trajectories. We also suggest that the quality of MM-based free energy computations based on MD simulations of complete GQs is more sensitive to the neglect of explicit polarization effects, which, in real systems, are associated with the presence of multiple closely spaced ions inside the GQs. Thus, although the MM-PBSA procedure provides very useful insights that complement the structural-dynamics data from MD trajectories of GQs, the method is far from reaching quantitative accuracy. Our conclusions are in agreement with critical assessments of the MM-PBSA methodology available in contemporary literature for other types of problems.},

Recently, this method has also been applied as a scoring function in computational drug design. Here a new tool g_mmpbsa, which implements the MM-PBSA approach using subroutines written in-house or sourced from the GROMACS and APBS packages is described. g_mmpbsa was developed as part of the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) consortium. Its aim is to integrate high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with binding energy calculations. The tool provides options to select alternative atomic radii and different nonpolar solvation models including models based on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), solvent accessible volume (SAV), and a model which contains both repulsive (SASA-SAV) and attractive components (described using a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen like integral method). We showcase the effectiveness of the tool by comparing the calculated interaction energy of 37 structurally diverse HIV-1 protease inhibitor complexes with their experimental binding free energies. The effect of varying several combinations of input parameters such as atomic radii, dielectric constant, grid resolution, solute-solvent dielectric boundary definition, and nonpolar models was investigated. g_mmpbsa can also be used to estimate the energy contribution per residue to the binding energy. It has been used to identify those residues in HIV-1 protease that are most critical for binding a range of inhibitors.},

Compared to its better known complement, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), WAXS targets higher scattering angles and can enhance structural studies of molecules by accessing finer details of solution structures. Although the extension from SAXS to WAXS is easy to implement experimentally, the computational tools required to fully harness the power of WAXS are still under development. Currently, WAXS is employed to study structural changes and ligand binding in proteins; however, the methods are not as fully developed for nucleic acids. Here, we show how WAXS can qualitatively characterize nucleic acid structures as well as the small but significant structural changes driven by the addition of multivalent ions. We show the potential of WAXS to test all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and to provide insight into understanding how the trivalent ion cobalt(III) hexammine (CoHex) affects the structure of RNA and DNA helices. We find that MD simulations capture the RNA structural change that occurs due to addition of CoHex.},

We show that these interstitial high dielectric regions are of significant magnitude in globular proteins, that they artificially increase solvation energies, and that they distort the free energy surface of nonbonded interactions.

The "vdW + epsilon (p) = 4" and "SE + epsilon (p) = 20" protocols predicted an overall electrostatic stabilization whereas the "SE + epsilon (p) = 4" protocol predicted an overall electrostatic destabilization. The "vdW + epsilon (p) = 4" protocol was most consistent with experiment. It quantitatively reproduced the observed effects of 17 mutations neutralizing charged residues lining the binding interface and the measured coupling energies of six charge pairs across the interface and reasonably rationalized the experimental ionic strength and pH dependences of the binding constant. In contrast, the "SE + epsilon (p) = 4" protocol predicted significantly larger coupling energies of charge pairs whereas the "SE + epsilon (p) = 20" protocol did not predict any pH dependence.

This release was developed to consolidate the existing codes into a single framework, while improving the parallelization of the code to better exploit modern multicore shared memory computer architectures. It is built using a modular object-oriented programming scheme, to allow for easy maintenance and extension of the software, and includes new features, such as adding flexible solute representations. We discuss a number of application examples, which describe some of the methods available in the release, and provide benchmarking data to demonstrate the parallel performance.},

  abstract      = {Protein molecular interaction fields are key determinants of protein functionality. PIPSA (Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis) is a procedure to compare and analyze protein molecular interaction fields, such as the electrostatic potential. PIPSA may assist in protein functional assignment, classification of proteins, the comparison of binding properties and the estimation of enzyme kinetic parameters. webPIPSA is a web server that enables the use of PIPSA to compare and analyze protein electrostatic potentials. While PIPSA can be run with downloadable software (see http://projects.eml.org/mcm/software/pipsa), webPIPSA extends and simplifies a PIPSA run. This allows non-expert users to perform PIPSA for their protein datasets. With input protein coordinates, the superposition of protein structures, as well as the computation and analysis of electrostatic potentials, is automated. The results are provided as electrostatic similarity matrices from an all-pairwise comparison of the proteins which can be subjected to clustering and visualized as epograms (tree-like diagrams showing electrostatic potential differences) or heat maps. webPIPSA is freely available at: http://pipsa.eml.org.},

  abstract  = {For routine pKa calculations of protein-ligand complexes in drug design, the PEOE method to compute partial charges was modified. The new method is applicable to a large scope of proteins and ligands. The adapted charges were parameterized using experimental free energies of solvation of amino acids and small organic ligands. For a data set of 80 small organic molecules, a correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.78 between calculated and experimental solvation free energies was obtained. Continuum electrostatics pKa calculations based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation were carried out on a validation set of nine proteins for which 132 experimental pKa values are known. In total, an overall RMSD of 0.88 log units between calculated and experimentally determined data is achieved. In particular, the predictions of significantly shifted pKa values are satisfactory, and reasonable estimates of protonation states in the active sites of lysozyme and xylanase could be obtained. Application of the charge-assignment and pKa-calculation procedure to protein-ligand complexes provides clear structural interpretations of experimentally observed changes of protonation states of functional groups upon complex formation. This information is essential for the interpretation of thermodynamic data of protein-ligand complex formation and provides the basis for the reliable factorization of the free energy of binding in enthalpic and entropic contributions. The modified charge-assignment procedure forms the basis for future automated pKa calculations of protein-ligand complexes. Proteins 2006; © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract      = {We have quantitatively studied the performance of a finite-difference Poisson−Boltzmann implicit solvent with respect to the TIP3P explicit solvent in a range of systems of biochemical interest. An overall agreement was found between the tested implicit and explicit solvents for hydrogen-bonding/salt-bridging dimers and peptide monomers and dimers of different conformations and different lengths. These comparative analyses also indicate a good transferability of empirically optimized parameters for the implicit solvent from small training molecules to large testing peptides. However, deviations between the two tested solvents are also apparent. Specifically, a consistent deviation was observed when hydrogen-bonding or salt-bridging dimers are within 4−6 Å. The deviation reaches a maximum at about 5.5 Å, the so-called water-bridging distance. The tested implicit solvent, even with optimized parameters, cannot capture the subtle fluctuation in the distance-dependent reaction field energy profiles, although smoothed profiles can still be obtained and are in overall agreement with those in the explicit solvent. Interestingly, the same mechanism underlining the above discrepancy is also responsible for the larger deviations of certain peptide conformations, such as parallel β-strand dimers. It is likely that the observed discrepancy may cause improper conformational distributions in simulations with the implicit solvent when hydrogen-bonding or salt-bridging interactions are crucial, such as secondary structure populations in proteins. Validation of the implicit solvent with optimized parameters in dynamics simulations will be the next step to study the influences of the observed discrepancy at biological conditions.

  abstract  = {A program is described for drawing the van der Waal's surface of a protein molecule. An extension of the program permits the accessibility of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin. Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be used as a qualitative guide at this stage. The average change in accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar (nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more "buried" in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on folding tend to be highly variable. ?? 1971.},

  abstract      = {Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are one of the most promising nanomaterials for use in medicine. The blood biocompatibility of CNT is a critical safety issue. In the bloodstream, proteins bind to CNT through non-covalent interactions to form a protein corona, thereby largely defining the biological properties of the CNT. Here, we characterize the interactions of carboxylated-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTCOOH) with common human proteins and investigate the effect of the different protein coronas on the interaction of CNTCOOH with human blood platelets (PLT). Molecular modeling and different photophysical techniques were employed to characterize the binding of albumin (HSA), fibrinogen (FBG), γ-globulins (IgG) and histone H1 (H1) on CNTCOOH. We found that the identity of protein forming the corona greatly affects the outcome of CNTCOOH's interaction with blood PLT. Bare CNTCOOH-induced PLT aggregation and the release of platelet membrane microparticles (PMP). HSA corona attenuated the PLT aggregating activity of CNTCOOH, while FBG caused the agglomeration of CNTCOOH nanomaterial, thereby diminishing the effect of CNTCOOH on PLT. In contrast, the IgG corona caused PLT fragmentation, and the H1 corona induced a strong PLT aggregation, thus potentiating the release of PMP.},
