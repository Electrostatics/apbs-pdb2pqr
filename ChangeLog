VERSION 0.1.1       08-29-01

I am slightly less pleased to announce the first bug-fix for APBS, version
0.1.1.  This fixes compilation problems that popped up for several folks,
including:
  * Syntax errors with non-GNU compilers
  * Errors in the installation instructions

VERSION 0.1.0       08-29-01
#############################################################################
I am pleased to announce the availability of a pre-beta version of the
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) code to selected research
groups.  APBS is new software designed to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation for very large biomolecular systems.  For more information,
please visit the APBS web site at http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/apbs.

This release is designed to allow interested users to get familiar
with the code.  It is not currently fully functional; it only provides
for the sequential multigrid (Cartesian mesh) solution of the
linearized and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation.  User-friendly
parallel support will be incorporated into the next release.  Other
limitations that may impact its immediate usefulness are:
    * No finite element support.  This is awaiting the public release
      of the Holst group's FEtk library.
    * Somewhat inefficient coefficient evaluation (i.e., problem
      setup).  This should be fixed in the next release or two.
Rather than serving as a production code, this release represents a
request for help in breaking the software and finding its deficiencies
before a public beta.

If you are interested in testing this early release, please go to
http://wasabi.ucsd.edu/~nbaker/apbs/download/.  Since this is not a
public release of APBS, you will need to enter the user-name
"apbs-beta" and the password "q94p$fa!" for access to this site.  Once
there, please follow the instructions to download and install APBS.

If you are not interested in trying out this early release, but would
like to stay informed about subsequent versions of APBS, please
consider subscribing to the APBS announcements mailing list by sending
the message "subscribe apbs-announce" to majordomo@mccammon.ucsd.edu.

Thank you for your time and interest in the APBS software.
