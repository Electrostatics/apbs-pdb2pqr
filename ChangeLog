BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.1       ??-??-02
#############################################################################
  * Syntax changes
    - The writepot and writeacc keywords have been generalized and new I/O
      features have been added.  The syntax is
      now:  write pot dx potential
            write smol dx potential
            etc.
      Please see the User's Manual for more information
    - The read keywords has been generalized and new I/O features have been
      added which support the use of pre-calculated coefficient grids, etc..
      The correct syntax for reading in a molecule is now 
      "read mol mol.pqr end"; please see the User's Manual for more
      information.
    - The "mg" keyword is no longer supported; all input files should use
      "mg-manual" or one of the other alternatives instead.
  * A change in the behavior of the "calcenergy" keyword; passing an argument
    of 2 to this keyword now prints out per-atom energies in addition to the
    energy component information
  * A new option has been added to tools/manip/acc to give per-atom solvent-
    accessible surface area contributions
  * Added tools/mesh/dxmath for performing arithmetic on grid-based data (i.e.,
    adding potential results from two calculations, etc.)
  * Added tools/mesh/uhbd_asc2bin for converting UHBD-format grid files from
    ASCII to binary (contributed by Dave Sept)
  * Improvement of VMD visualization scripts (contributed by Dave Sept)
  * The API has changed significantly; please see the Programmer's Manual.

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.8       01-29-02
#############################################################################
This version is a public (beta) release candidate and includes the following

    Jung-Hsin Lin)
You should definitely upgrade, the previous versions may produce unreliable
results.

PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.6       11-17-01
#############################################################################
This version is a public (beta) release candidate and includes the following
bug-fixes and features:
  * Fixed printf formatting in UHBD potential output
  * Added input file support for parallel focusing
  * Fixed small bug in parsing writeacc syntax (thanks, Dave)
  * Added output file support for parallel focusing

You need to download a new version of MALOC for this release.

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.5       10-25-01
#############################################################################
This version features minor bug fixes and several new features:
  * Fixed shift in center of geometry for OpenDX I/O
  * Made energy evaluation more robust when using NPBE
  * Rearrangments of files and modified compilation behavior
  * Input file support for ion species of varying valency and concentration
  * Input file support incorrect nlev/dime combinations; APBS now finds 
    acceptable settings near to the user's requested values
  * "Automatic focusing".  Users now simply specify the physical parameters
    (temperature, dielectric, etc.), the coarse and fine grid lengths and
    centers, and APBS calculates the rest

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.4       09-18-01
#############################################################################
This version features major bug fixes introduced in the 0.1.3 release:
  * Chain ID support has been **removed** from the PDB/PQR parser (if anyone
    has a nice, flexible PDB parser they'd like to contribute to the code, I'd
    appreciate it)
  * Configure script has been made compatible with OSF
  * Bug fix in disabling FEtk-specific header files

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.3       09-13-01
#############################################################################
This version features a few improvements in scripts, PDB parsing flexibility,
and portability, including:
  * Dave Sept upgraded the psize and shift scripts to allow more flexibility in
    PDB formats.
  * Chain ID support has been added to the PDB/PQR parser
  * Removed -g from compiler flags during linking of C and FORTAN under OSF
    (thanks to Dagmar Floeck and Julie Mitchell for help debugging this
     problem)

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.2       09-02-01
#############################################################################
This version is mainly designed to increase portability by switching to libtool
for library creation and linking.  Of course, it also contains a few bug fixes.
Highlights include:
  * Changes to the User Manual
  * Addition of a Programmer's Manual
  * Various FEtk-related things (no particular impact to the user)
  * Improvements to the test systems
  * Change in the format for printing energies
  * Change in directory structure
  * Fixed centering bug in main driver (only impacted I/o)
  * Fixed error message bug in VPMG class
  * Fixed grid length bug (popped up during sanity checks) in VPMG class
  * Switched to libtool for linking
Note that Compaq Tru64 Alpha users may still experience problems while
compiling due to some strangess with linking C and FORTRAN objects.

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.1       08-29-01
#############################################################################
I am slightly less pleased to announce the first bug-fix for APBS, version
0.1.1.  This fixes compilation problems that popped up for several folks,
including:
  * Syntax errors with non-GNU compilers
  * Errors in the installation instructions
  * Installation of binary in machine-specific directory

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.0       08-29-01
#############################################################################
I am pleased to announce the availability of a pre-beta version of the
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) code to selected research
groups.  APBS is new software designed to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation for very large biomolecular systems.  For more information,
please visit the APBS web site at http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/apbs.

This release is designed to allow interested users to get familiar
with the code.  It is not currently fully functional; it only provides
for the sequential multigrid (Cartesian mesh) solution of the
linearized and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation.  User-friendly
parallel support will be incorporated into the next release.  Other
limitations that may impact its immediate usefulness are:
    * No finite element support.  This is awaiting the public release
      of the Holst group's FEtk library.
    * Somewhat inefficient coefficient evaluation (i.e., problem
      setup).  This should be fixed in the next release or two.
Rather than serving as a production code, this release represents a
request for help in breaking the software and finding its deficiencies
before a public beta.

If you are interested in testing this early release, please go to
http://wasabi.ucsd.edu/~nbaker/apbs/download/.  Since this is not a
public release of APBS, you will need to enter the user-name
"apbs-beta" and the password "q94p$fa!" for access to this site.  Once
there, please follow the instructions to download and install APBS.

If you are not interested in trying out this early release, but would
like to stay informed about subsequent versions of APBS, please
consider subscribing to the APBS announcements mailing list by sending
the message "subscribe apbs-announce" to majordomo@mccammon.ucsd.edu.

Thank you for your time and interest in the APBS software.
