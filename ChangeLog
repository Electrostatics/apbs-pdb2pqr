# These are notes for the current version of APBS
* Removed FORTRAN dependency from APBS
    - Direct line by line translation of all source from contrib/pmgZ
    - Functions replaced and tested incrementally to ensure code congruence
    - Created new subfolder src/pmgc for translated pmg library
    - Created new macros for 2d, 3d matrix access
        > In src/generic/vmatrix.h
        > Simulate native FORTRAN 2 and 3 dimensional arrays
        > Use 1-indexed, column-major ordering
        > Allowed direct 1-1 translation from FORTRAN to ensurre code congruence
* Added additional debugging and output macros to src/generic/vhal.h
    - Added message, error message, assertion, warning, and abort macros
    - Macro behavior modified by enabling debug mode during build
        > Non-error messages directed to stderr in debug, io.mc otherwise
        > All error messages are directed to stdout
        > In debug mode, verbose location information is provided
* Added additional capabilities during configure stage
    - FETK_PATH
        > Specifies location of fetk libraries
        > Used for Finite Element builds
        > Used to search for external maloc library
    - BUILD_DOC
        > Allows optional generation of documentation (requires doxygen)
    - BUILD_TOOLS
        > Allows optional compilation of APBS supplemental tools
    - ENABLE_DEBUG
        > Eliminates compilation optimization
        > Includes line number and file information in warnings / debug messages
    - ENABLE_VERBOSE_DEBUG
        > Prints too much debugging information for functions
* Transitioned to git version control from subversion
    - Code is still hosted on sourceforge
    - Past revision information also converted to git
    - Repository for Read/Write maintenance located:
      ssh://tuckerbeck@apbs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/apbs/apbs 
    - Repository for Read-only access located:
      git://apbs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/apbs/apbs
* Converted build system from Automake to CMake
    - All autotools configuration/build files and directories removed
        > Makefile.am, Makefile.im, configure.ac, config/, etc
    - Converted functionality to CMake native scripts
        > CMakeLists.txt
    - Converted contributed maloc module to CMake as well
        > Source bundled as a tarball in contrib/
        > If maloc is not detected on the system during configuration:
            ~ contrib/maloc.tar.gz is extracted and built
            ~ libmaloc.so installed with apbs during install
    - Removed extraneous bundled libraries from contrib
        > pmgZ/
            ~ Replaced by conversion of fortran and inclusion of src/pmgc
            ~ Now native to APBS
        > blas/
            ~ Originally used to bundle routines for fortran code
            ~ Functionality now utilized by linking against native blas library
        > zlib/
            ~ Necessary for APBS to read from zipped input files
            ~ zlib functionality is optional.  Enabled at configure time
            ~ If enabled, configure searches for external zlib
            ~ The zlib library is easily obtained for any platform, so inclusion
              in contrib deemed unneccessary.
        > opal/
            ~ Necessary for web based interface
            ~ Opal interface is experimental, not fully supported
            ~ Further work is scheduled for web interface and refactoring
            ~ If needed, dependencies are left to user to acquire/install
    - If requested, documentation is built using Doxygen at build time
    - All libraries are now built as shared by default istead of static
    - Added build subfolder.  It is recommended to run cmake from this subfolder
* Minor refactor of code structure
    - APBS components built as independent shared libraries
        > subfolders in src each built as a shared library
            ~ src/generic --> libapbs_generic
            ~ src/fem     --> libapbs_fem
            ~ src/mg      --> libapbs_mg
            ~ src/pmgc    --> libapbs_pmgc
        > Libraries deployed at install time to selected install prefix/lib
    - APBS header files moved into directories with source files
        > "apbs" no longer used as prefix within apbs code
        > Include paths within APBS require inclusion of library name
            ~ #include "apbs/vhal.h"  -->  #include "generic/vhal.h"
        > Include paths external to APBS requre inclusion of "abps" and library
            ~ #include "apbs/vhal.h"  -->  #include "apbs/generic/vhal.h"
    - All source files moved out of bin folder
        > The bin folder will now hold only compiled binaries
        > Source files from bin have been moved to src/
        > apbs.c renamed to main.c
* Major refactor of examples & test structure
    - Scattered test scripts unified into a single test program
    - Added a tests/ subfolder
        > Rewrote tests in python.  Test program is tests/apbs_tester.py
        > APBS inputs and expected results described in tests/test_cases.cfg
        > Individual tests run by specifying their names on the command line
          $ python apbs_tester.py -t actin-dimer
    - Removed all scripts from examples/ subfolder
        > Eliminated scattered test.sh, runme.sh scripts
        > Removed autotools and Makefile* scripts
    - The examples/ subfolder now includes only example APBS inputs and pdb/pqr
    - Future tests may be added simply by modifying tests/test_cases.cfg
* Install bundle modified slightly
    - Install prefix specified during CMake configuration stage
      apbs/build$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=prefix
    - APBS libraries are installed to prefix/lib/
    - If contrib/maloc was required, it is installed to prefix/lib
    - APBS binaries are installed to prefix/bin/
    - APBS includes are installed to prefix/include/apbs/
    - doc, examples, tets, tools installed to prefix/share/apbs/
