# These are notes for the current version of APBS
* Added tools/matlab/solver with simple Matlab LPBE solver for prototyping,
teaching, etc.

# BUGFIXES
* Added in warning into focusFillBound if there is a large value detected
  in setting the boundary conditions during a focusing calculation
* Added in a check and abort in Vpmg_qmEnergy if chopped values are
  detected. This seems to occur under certain conditions for npbe calcs.
* Fixed a bug in Vpmg_MolIon that causes npbe based calculaions
  to return very large energies.
