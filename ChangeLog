# These are notes for the current version of APBS
* Removed FORTRAN dependency from APBS
    - Direct line by line translation of all source from contrib/pmgZ
    - Functions replaced and tested incrementally to ensure code congruence
    - Created new subfolder src/pmgC for translated pmg library
    - Created new macros for 2d, 3d matrix access
        > In src/generic/apbs/vmatrix.h
        > Simulate native FORTRAN 2 and 3 dimensional arrays
        > Use 1-indexed, column-major ordering
        > Allowed direct 1-1 translation from FORTRAN to ensurre code congruence
* Added additional debugging and output macros to src/generic/apbs/vhal.h
    - Added message, error message, assertion, warning, and abort macros
    - Macro behavior modified by the --enable-debug flag for configure
        > Non-error messages directed to stderr in debug, io.mc otherwise
        > All error messages are directed to stdout
        > In debug mode, verbose location information is provided
* Added additional flags to configure
    - --with-fetk replaces FETK_INCLUDE, FETK_LIBRARY environment flags
    - --with-efence enables compiling with electric fence library
    - --enable-debug eliminates compiling optimization and includes line no info
    - --enable-profiling adds profiling information and sets --enable-debug
    - --enable-verbose-debug prints lots of function specific information

# REMOVED CODE
* contrib/pmgZ has been removed
* contrib/blas has been removed
