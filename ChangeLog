BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.6       ??-??-03
#############################################################################

  * Made autoconf/automake configure setup more robust on Solaris 8 platforms
    (thanks to Ben Carrington!)
  * Fixed minor bugs in documentation formatting
  * Made Vopot more robust
 
#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.6       01-17-03
#############################################################################
 
  * Changed license to GPL 
  * Made a few routines compliant with ANSI X3.159-1989 by 
	removing snprintf (compliant with ISO/IEC 9899:1999).  This is basically
    for the sake of OSF support.

BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.5       11-21-02
#############################################################################

  * Improved consistency between energies evaluated with "chgm 0" and "chgm 1"
  * Made charge-field energy evaluation consistent for user-supplied charge
    maps
  * Added new psize.py script courtesy of Todd Dolinsky.
  * Updated list of APBS-related tools in User Guide.
  * Added RPM capabilities courtesy of Steve Bond.
  * Removed annoying excess verbosity from Vgrid.
  * Updated Blue Horizon compilation instructions (thanks to Robert Konecny and
    Giri Chukkapalli)
  * Updated autoconf/automake/libtool setup and added --disable-tools option

#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.4       10-21-02
#############################################################################

  * Fixed bug which set one of the  z-boundaries to zero for "bcfl 1".  This
	can perturb results for systems where the grid boundaries are particularly
	close to the biomolecule.  While this is an embarassing bug, most systems
    using settings suggested by the psize script appear largely unaffected
	(see examples/README.html).  Thanks to Michael Grabe for finding this bug
    (Michael, you can stop finding bugs now...)
  * Updated VMD scripts to agree with the current OpenDX output format
  * A COMMENT:  As far as I can tell, the current version of OpenDX-formatted
    output (same as version 0.2.3) is fully compliant with the OpenDX
    standards (see, for example, 
    http://opendx.npaci.edu/docs/html/pages/usrgu065.htm#HDRXMPLES).  
    However, I realize this is different than the format for previous versions
    and would encourage all users to update their APBS-based applications to
    accomodate these changes.  The best solution would be for all downstream
    applications to use the APBS Vgrid class (see
	http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/doc/api/html/group__Vgrid.html) to manipulate
    the data since this class should remain internally consistent between
    releases.  Finally, I would love to have some OpenDX guru who uses APBS to
	contact me so I can solidfy the data ouput format of APBS.  I'm about ready
    to permanently switch to another format if I can't reach a consensus with
    OpenDX...

BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.3       10-09-02
#############################################################################

  * Fixed bugs in salt-dependent Helmholtz/nonlinear term of PBE affecting
	both LPBE and NPBE calculations.  While this bug fix only changes most 
    energies by < 2 kJ/mol, it is recommended that all users upgrade.  Many
    thanks to Michael Grabe for finding and carefully documenting this bug!
  * A parameter (chgm) has been added which controls the charge discretization
    method used.  Therefore, this version contains substantial changes in both
	the API and input file syntax.  Specifically:
    - PBEparm has two new members (chgm, setchgm)
    - Vpmg_fillco requires another argument
    - Vpmg_*Force functions require additional arguments
    - Input files must now contain the keyword "chgm #" where # is an integer
    Please see the documentation for more information.
  * Fixed problems with "slicing" off chunks of the mesh during I/O of focused
    calculations
  * Updated authors list
  * New CHARMM parameters -- Robert Konecny
  * Created enumerations for common surface and charge discretization methods
  * Added Vmgrid class to support easy manipulation of nested grid data
  * Added more verbosity to error with NPBE forces
  * Added working Python wrappers -- Todd Dolinksy
  * Modified VMD scripts read_dx and loadstuff.vmd


#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.2       08-14-02
#############################################################################

  * There were several other changes along the way... I lost track.
  * Changed coordinate indexing in some energy calculations
  * Updated documentation to reflect recent changes on Blue Horizon
  * Improved speed of problem setup BUT NOW RESTRICT use of input coefficient
    maps (see documentation)
  * Updated documentation, placing particular emphasis on use of Intel
    compilers and vendor BLAS on Intel Linux systems
  * Fixed bug for nonpolar force evaluation in Vpmg_dbnpForce
  * Removed MG test scripts -- use bin/*.c for templates/testing
  * Made main driver code completely memory-leak free (i.e., if you wanted to
    wrap it and call it repeatedly -- Thanks to Robert Konecny)
  * Fixed main driver code for compatibility with SGI compilers (Thanks to
    Fabrice Leclerc)
  * Made focused evaluation of forces more sensible.
  * Added 'print force' statement
  * Fixed bug in OpenDX input/output (OpenDX documentation is lousy!)

#############################################################################
BETA PUBLIC RELEASE VERSION 0.2.1       04-23-02
#############################################################################
This version requires the latest version of MALOC to work properly!
  * Syntax changes
    - The writepot and writeacc keywords have been generalized and new I/O
      features have been added.  The syntax is
      now:  write pot dx potential
            write smol dx potential
            etc.
      Please see the User's Manual for more information
    - The read keywords has been generalized and new I/O features have been
      added which support the use of pre-calculated coefficient grids, etc..
      The correct syntax for reading in a molecule is now 
      "read mol pqr mol.pqr end"; please see the User's Manual for more
      information.
    - The "mg" keyword is no longer supported; all input files should use
      "mg-manual" or one of the other alternatives instead.
  * A change in the behavior of the "calcenergy" keyword; passing an argument
    of 2 to this keyword now prints out per-atom energies in addition to the
    energy component information
  * A new option has been added to tools/manip/acc to give per-atom solvent-
    accessible surface area contributions
  * A new option has been added to tools/manip/coulomb to give per-atom 
    electrostatic energies
  * Added tools/mesh/dxmath for performing arithmetic on grid-based data (i.e.,
    adding potential results from two calculations, etc.)
  * Added tools/mesh/uhbd_asc2bin for converting UHBD-format grid files from
    ASCII to binary (contributed by Dave Sept)
  * Improvement of VMD visualization scripts (contributed by Dave Sept)
  * The API has changed significantly; please see the Programmer's Manual.
  * Working (but still experimental) Python wrappers for major APBS functions.
  * More flexible installation capabilities (pointed out by Steve Bond)
  * Added ability to use vendor-supplied BLAS
  * Brought up-to-date with new MALOC

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.1       08-29-01
#############################################################################
I am slightly less pleased to announce the first bug-fix for APBS, version
0.1.1.  This fixes compilation problems that popped up for several folks,
including:
  * Syntax errors with non-GNU compilers
  * Errors in the installation instructions
  * Installation of binary in machine-specific directory

#############################################################################
PRE-BETA (NOT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE) VERSION 0.1.0       08-29-01
#############################################################################
I am pleased to announce the availability of a pre-beta version of the
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) code to selected research
groups.  APBS is new software designed to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation for very large biomolecular systems.  For more information,
please visit the APBS web site at http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/apbs.

This release is designed to allow interested users to get familiar
with the code.  It is not currently fully functional; it only provides
for the sequential multigrid (Cartesian mesh) solution of the
linearized and nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation.  User-friendly
parallel support will be incorporated into the next release.  Other
limitations that may impact its immediate usefulness are:
    * No finite element support.  This is awaiting the public release
      of the Holst group's FEtk library.
    * Somewhat inefficient coefficient evaluation (i.e., problem
      setup).  This should be fixed in the next release or two.
Rather than serving as a production code, this release represents a
request for help in breaking the software and finding its deficiencies
before a public beta.

If you are interested in testing this early release, please go to
http://wasabi.ucsd.edu/~nbaker/apbs/download/.  Since this is not a
public release of APBS, you will need to enter the user-name
"apbs-beta" and the password "q94p$fa!" for access to this site.  Once
there, please follow the instructions to download and install APBS.

If you are not interested in trying out this early release, but would
like to stay informed about subsequent versions of APBS, please
consider subscribing to the APBS announcements mailing list by sending
the message "subscribe apbs-announce" to majordomo@mccammon.ucsd.edu.

Thank you for your time and interest in the APBS software.
