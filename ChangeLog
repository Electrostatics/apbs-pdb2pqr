# These are notes for the current version of APBS
* Added a new program for converting delphi potential maps to OpenDX format. tools/mesh/del2dx
* Updated Doxygen manual with call/caller graphs.  Replaced HTML with PDF.
* Added tools/matlab/solver with simple Matlab LPBE solver for prototyping, teaching, etc.
* Deprecated APBS XML output format.
* Deprecated nlev keyword.
* Added etol keyword, which allows user-defined error tolerance in LPBE and NPBE calculations (default errtol value is 1.0e-6).
* Added more explanatory error messages for the case in which parm keyword is missing from APBS input file for apolar calculations.
* Added a polar and apolor forces calculation example to examples/born/ .

# BUGFIXES
* Modified Vpmg_dbForce with some grid checking code provided by Matteo Rotter.
* Fixed a bug in psize.py per Michael Lerner's suggestion. The old version of psize.py gives wrong cglen and fglen results in special cases (e.g., all y coordinates are negative values).
* Fixed a bug in examples/scripts/checkforces.sh: the condition for "Passed with rounding error" is abs(difference) < errortol, not the other way around.
* Fixed the help string in ApbsClient.py .
