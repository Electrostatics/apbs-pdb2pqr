08-29-01  Version 0.1.0
  This is a pre-beta release designed to allow interested users to get familiar
  with the code.   It is not currently fully functional; it only provides for
  the sequential multigrid (Cartesian mesh) solution of the linearized and
  nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation.   User-friendly parallel support will
  be incorporated into the next release.  Other limitations that may effect
  performance are:
    * No finite element support.  This is awaiting the public release of the
      Holst group's FEtk
    * Somewhat inefficient coefficient evaluation (i.e., problem setup).  This
      should be fixed in the next release or two.
  In summary, this release represents a request for help in breaking the code
  and finding its deficiencies before a public beta.
