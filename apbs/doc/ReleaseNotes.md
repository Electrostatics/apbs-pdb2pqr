Dearest APBS users,

We are pleased to announce the latest release of APBS 1.5  The latest
version of APBS includes several notable features and bug fixes.  This
release includes a major rewrite of the Poisson-Boltzmann Semi-Anlytical Method (PBAM) and the Treecode-Accelerated Boundary Integral method (TABI) with APBS in an
externals directory.  In addition, there is a new implementation of the Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical Method. We have made major modification to improve the build system to create out of source builds. Our bug fixes include changes to CMake to work more smoothly on Windows.

For help with installation, building, or running APBS, please visit https://gitter.im/Electrostatics/help.
