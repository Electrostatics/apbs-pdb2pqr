External Packages
===================

If you want to update the submodule to the 
latest commit available, that isn't done with

`git submodule update`

To update the commit, go to the submodue directory:
`externals/submodule/` and do the following:

1. git checkout master
2. git pull

This will update it within the submodule. Then you can

`cd ../../`

And add changes to the APBS repo.
