/*
* Name:	multivalue.c
* Author(s):	Adrian Kaats
*		Effectively, Nathan Baker as well (the majority of this program is directly copied from
*		value.c distributed in apbs/tools/mesh with the source version of apbs-0.4.0 - please see
* 		this function for reference and more importantly for any licensing issues).
* Date:	November 29, 2006
*
* Description:	Accepts a CSV (with no column titles) file containing 3D coordinates for which the
*			value from a DX-formatted grid is evaluated.  The original coordinates and their its
* 			values are output to a text file formatted exactly like the input but with one extra
*			column containing the calculated value at the point.  This program will also either
*			append an existing io.mc, or create it if it doesn't exist in the directory from which
*			it is called.
*
* Usage:		> multivalue csvCoordinatesFile dxFormattedFile outputFile
*
*			Example of input file contents:	123.234,23.8E03,9.6e-4
*								5.9,6.2,0.3
*								-7e3,91,0.6
*
*				NOTE	-No white space allowed anywhere on a line (ex. no space after commas)
*					-No blank lines allowed at the top of the file (blank lines OK at the end)
*					-No column headers/titles
*
* Programming notes:
* 	1)	This program uses the convention that exiting with a 0 represents success (even in the case
*		where the program can't do anything: example --> user input coordinate file contains no data).
*		The program exits with a 1 upon failure (ex. any kind of I/O error, or error code generated by
*		external routines such as Vgrid routines).
* 	2)	Vgrid routines use convention that returning 1 is success.  Also note that Vgrid routines,
* 		I believe, use VASSERT which can terminate the entire program with an abort() signal which is
*		not handled here.
* 	3)	The original 'value.c' routine written by Nathan Baker uses the convention that returning 0
*		represents success - that convention is carried on here...
* 	4)	To compile this program, you will need to have apbscfg.h and vclist.h in an appropriate include
* 		directory - these do not seem to be created by RPM installations of APBS or its tools.
*
*	MANY THANKS to David Gohara without whom I (Adrian) would have spent untold ages trying to compile this
