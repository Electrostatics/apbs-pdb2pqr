# Patching c34b2
#

To apply the patches:

export PATCH_DIR=`pwd`

cd to your CHARMM_DIR

patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/pbeq.patch
patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/Makefile_gnu.patch
patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/install.patch


After patching the source you have to copy modules/CHARMM/*.f modules
to the source tree.

cp iapbs/modules/CHARMM/apbs.f     $CHARMM_DIR/source/misc/apbs.src
cp iapbs/modules/CHARMM/apbs_fcm.f $CHARMM_DIR/source/fcm/apbs.fcm
