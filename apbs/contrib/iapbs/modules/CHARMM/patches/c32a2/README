Note: iAPBS module is included in the source CHARMM distribution from
version c32 so this patching procedure is not necessary.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To apply the patches:

export PATCH_DIR=`pwd`

cd your CHARMM_DIR

patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/pbeq.patch
patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/energy.patch
patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/misc.patch
patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/Makefile_gnu.patch
patch -p0 < $PATCH_DIR/install.patch


After patching the source you have to copy CHARMM/APBS modules to the
source tree.

cd $IAPBS_DIR
cp CHARMM/apbs.f $CHARMM_DIR/source/misc/apbs.src
cp CHARMM/apbs_fcm.f $CHARMM_DIR/source/fcm/apbs.fcm

where $IAPBS_DIR is the root directory of iAPBS distribution and
$CHARMM_DIR is root directory of CHARMM distribution.
