                             APBS Module   

    The APBS module integrates APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann
Solver, http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs) with CHARMM. For detailed
documentation and implementation information please see the official
iAPBS web site http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/iapbs

Description
-----------

APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) is a software package for the
numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), one of the
most popular continuum models for describing electrostatic
interactions between molecular solutes in salty, aqueous media. APBS
was designed to efficiently evaluate electrostatic properties for a
wide range of length scales to enable the investigation of molecules
with tens to millions of atoms.

The APBS/CHARMM module makes most of the APBS functionality available
from within CHARMM. This allows to perform variety of calculations
which includes: evaluation of electrostatic properties of biomolecular
systems, performing optimization and molecular dynamics in implicit
solvent using APBS calculated solvation forces, visualization of
calculated electrostatic properties, etc.

Since this module's functionality overlaps in many aspects
functionality of the CHARMM's PBEQ module please read also pbeq.doc
file and example input files.

Syntax
------

The APBS/CHARMM module mimics APBS syntax as close as possible. For
detailed description and discussion of all APBS parameters please see
APBS documentation (http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/doc/index.html) and
APBS/CHARMM documentation
(http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/iapbs/usersguide/index.html) for specific
instructions for using APBS inside of CHARMM.

Installation
------------

For complete installation instructions please see 
http://mccammon.ucsd.edu/iapbs/usersguide/index.html

In summary:

1. first download and install the following packages: atlas (BLAS),
   maloc, apbs and iapbs

2. set the following environment variables APBS_LIB, IAPBS_LIB,
   APBS_BLAS:

   APBS_LIB  - points to where libapbs.lib and libmaloc.a are installed
   IAPBS_LIB - points to where iapbs.a is installed
   APBS_BLAS "-L${BLAS_LIB} -llapack -lcblas -lf77blas -latlas"
	     where BLAS_LIB is a directory where BLAS library is
	     located; these flags are BLAS-dependent, the above
	     example works with ATLAS

3. run 'install.com gnu medium APBS' to compile APBS-enabled CHARMM


Examples
--------

There are three example input files provided with this release:

Example (1)

- Simple calculation of electrostatic energies (apbs_elstat.inp)

This shows how to do a single point electrostatic evaluation on a
molecule. The result is electrostatic energy of the molecule.

  set elstaten1 = ?enpb

END

calc solv = @elstaten80 - @elstaten1


Example (2)

- Molecular dynamics in implicit solvent (apbs_md.inp)

This is an example of a short molecular dynamics simulation in
implicit solvent using APBS-calculated solvation forces.

Example (3)

- Visualization of calculated elstat properties (apbs_vis.inp)

This input file show how to generate properties files (electrostatics,
SASA and charge) which can be then visualized using an external
application (VMD, PyMol, OpenDX, etc; for details please see the APBS
Tutorial at http://agave.wustl.edu/apbs/doc/html/tutorial/index.html).
