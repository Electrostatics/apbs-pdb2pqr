README for smpbe APBS example
=====================================

The example input files included in this directory solve the Size Modified PBE as described by [Chu V, et al. Biophys J, 93(9):3202-9, 2007(doi:10.1529/biophysj.106.099168](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2025650/). SMPBE does not assume ions are infinitely small as in the standard PBE. This method uses finite ion sizes through a gas lattice formulation.
