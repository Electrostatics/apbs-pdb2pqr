@article{SAMPL,
	Abstract = {Here, we give an overview of the small molecule hydration portion of the SAMPL4 challenge, which focused on predicting hydration free energies for a series of 47 small molecules. These gas-to-water transfer free energies have in the past proven a valuable test of a variety of computational methods and force fields. Here, in contrast to some previous SAMPL challenges, we find a relatively wide range of methods perform quite well on this test set, with RMS errors in the 1.2 kcal/mol range for several of the best performing methods. Top-performers included a quantum mechanical approach with continuum solvent models and functional group corrections, alchemical molecular dynamics simulations with a classical all-atom force field, and a single-conformation Poisson-Boltzmann approach. While 1.2 kcal/mol is still a significant error, experimental hydration free energies covered a range of nearly 20 kcal/mol, so methods typically showed substantial predictive power. Here, a substantial new focus was on evaluation of error estimates, as predicting when a computational prediction is reliable versus unreliable has considerable practical value. We found, however, that in many cases errors are substantially underestimated, and that typically little effort has been invested in estimating likely error. We believe this is an important area for further research.},

@article{ISATAB,
	Abstract = {This article summarizes the motivation for, and the proceedings of, the first ISA-TAB workshop held December 6-8, 2007, at the EBI, Cambridge, UK. This exploratory workshop, organized by members of the Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) Society's Reporting Structure for Biological Investigations (RSBI) working group, brought together a group of developers of a range of collaborative systems to discuss the use of a common format to address the pressing need of reporting and communicating data and metadata from biological, biomedical, and environmental studies employing combinations of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics technologies along with more conventional methodologies. The expertise of the participants comprised database development, data management, and hands-on experience in the development of data communication standards. The workshop's outcomes are set to help formalize the proposed Investigation, Study, Assay (ISA)-TAB tab-delimited format for representing and communicating experimental metadata. This article is part of the special issue of OMICS on the activities of the Genomics Standards Consortium (GSC).},

@article{Karlsberg,
	Abstract = {pK(A) in proteins are determined by electrostatic energy computations using a small number of optimized protein conformations derived from crystal structures. In these protein conformations hydrogen positions and geometries of salt bridges on the protein surface were determined self-consistently with the protonation pattern at three pHs (low, ambient, and high). Considering salt bridges at protein surfaces is most relevant, since they open at low and high pH. In the absence of these conformational changes, computed pK(A)(comp) of acidic (basic) groups in salt bridges underestimate (overestimate) experimental pK(A)(exp), dramatically. The pK(A)(comp) for 15 different proteins with 185 known pK(A)(exp) yield an RMSD of 1.12, comparable with two other methods. One of these methods is fully empirical with many adjustable parameters. The other is also based on electrostatic energy computations using many non-optimized side chain conformers but employs larger dielectric constants at short distances of charge pairs that diminish their electrostatic interactions. These empirical corrections that account implicitly for additional conformational flexibility were needed to describe the energetics of salt bridges appropriately. This is not needed in the present approach. The RMSD of the present approach improves if one considers only strongly shifted pK(A)(exp) in contrast to the other methods under these conditions. Our method allows interpreting pK(A)(comp) in terms of pH dependent hydrogen bonding pattern and salt bridge geometries. A web service is provided to perform pK(A) computations.},

@article{Chimera,
	Abstract = {The design, implementation, and capabilities of an extensible visualization system, UCSF Chimera, are discussed. Chimera is segmented into a core that provides basic services and visualization, and extensions that provide most higher level functionality. This architecture ensures that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate new features. Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.},

@article{PMV,
	Abstract = {Increasingly complex research has made it more difficult to prepare data for publication, education, and outreach. Many scientists must also wade through black-box code to interface computational algorithms from diverse sources to supplement their bench work. To reduce these barriers we have developed an open-source plug-in, embedded Python Molecular Viewer (ePMV), that runs molecular modeling software directly inside of professional 3D animation applications (hosts) to provide simultaneous access to the capabilities of these newly connected systems. Uniting host and scientific algorithms into a single interface allows users from varied backgrounds to assemble professional quality visuals and to perform computational experiments with relative ease. By enabling easy exchange of algorithms, ePMV can facilitate interdisciplinary research, smooth communication between broadly diverse specialties, and provide a common platform to frame and visualize the increasingly detailed intersection(s) of cellular and molecular biology.},

@article{Page:2006,
	Abstract = {An application of the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) protocol to the prediction of protein kinase inhibitor selectivity is presented. Six different inhibitors are placed in equivalent orientations in each of six different receptors. Fully solvated molecular dynamics is then run for 1 ns on each of the 36 complexes, and the resulting trajectories scored, using the implicit solvent model. The results show some correlation with experimentally-determined specificities; anomalies may be attributed to a variety of causes, including difficulties in quantifying induced fit penalties and variabilities in normal modes calculations. Decomposing interaction energies on a per-residue basis yields more useful insights into the natures of the binding modes and suggests that the real value of such calculations lies in understanding interactions rather than outright prediction.},

The calculated results were in a good agreement with the experimentally determined DeltaG(bind) values, thereby pointing to the MM-PBSA protocol as a valuable computational tool for the rational design of specific agents targeting the neuronal alpha7 nAChR subtypes.},

@article{Islam:2016,
	Abstract = {The self-assembly and stability of DNA G-quadruplexes (GQs) are affected by the intrinsic stability of different GpG base steps embedded in their G-quartet stems. We have carried out MD simulations followed by MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) free energy calculations on all the experimentally observed three-quartet intramolecular human telomeric GQ topologies. We also studied antiparallel GQ models with alternative syn-anti patterns of the G-quartets. We tested different ions, dihedral variants of the DNA force field, water models, and simulation lengths. In total, ~35 �s of simulations have been carried out. The systems studied here are considerably more complete than the previously analyzed two-quartet stems. Among other effects, our computations included the stem-loop coupling and ion-ion interactions inside the stem. The calculations showed a broad agreement with the earlier predictions. However, the increase in the completeness of the system was associated with increased noise of the free energy data which could be related, for example, to the presence of long-lived loop substates and rather complex dynamics for the two bound ions inside the G-stem. As a result, the MM-PBSA data were noisy and we could not improve their quantitative convergence even by expanding the simulations to 2.5 �s long trajectories. We also suggest that the quality of MM-based free energy computations based on MD simulations of complete GQs is more sensitive to the neglect of explicit polarization effects, which, in real systems, are associated with the presence of multiple closely spaced ions inside the GQs. Thus, although the MM-PBSA procedure provides very useful insights that complement the structural-dynamics data from MD trajectories of GQs, the method is far from reaching quantitative accuracy. Our conclusions are in agreement with critical assessments of the MM-PBSA methodology available in contemporary literature for other types of problems.},

@article{gmmpbsa,
	Abstract = {Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA), a method to estimate interaction free energies, has been increasingly used in the study of biomolecular interactions. Recently, this method has also been applied as a scoring function in computational drug design. Here a new tool g_mmpbsa, which implements the MM-PBSA approach using subroutines written in-house or sourced from the GROMACS and APBS packages is described. g_mmpbsa was developed as part of the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) consortium. Its aim is to integrate high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with binding energy calculations. The tool provides options to select alternative atomic radii and different nonpolar solvation models including models based on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), solvent accessible volume (SAV), and a model which contains both repulsive (SASA-SAV) and attractive components (described using a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen like integral method). We showcase the effectiveness of the tool by comparing the calculated interaction energy of 37 structurally diverse HIV-1 protease inhibitor complexes with their experimental binding free energies. The effect of varying several combinations of input parameters such as atomic radii, dielectric constant, grid resolution, solute-solvent dielectric boundary definition, and nonpolar models was investigated. g_mmpbsa can also be used to estimate the energy contribution per residue to the binding energy. It has been used to identify those residues in HIV-1 protease that are most critical for binding a range of inhibitors.},

However, the surface tension at a hydrocarbon-water interface, which is a "macroscopic" measure of the hydrophobic effect, is approximately 72 cal mol-1 A-2. In an attempt to reconcile these values, alkane solubility data have been reevaluated to account for solute-solvent size differences, leading to a revised "microscopic" hydrophobic effect of 47 cal mol-1 A-2. This value, when used in a simple geometric model for the curvature dependence of the hydrophobic effect, predicts a macroscopic alkane-water surface tension that is close to the macroscopic value.},

In contrast to the Lee and Richards molecular surface, atom-centered surfaces result in interatomic crevices and buried pockets of high dielectric which are too small for a solvent molecule to occupy. We show that these interstitial high dielectric regions are of significant magnitude in globular proteins, that they artificially increase solvation energies, and that they distort the free energy surface of nonbonded interactions. These results suggest that implicit solvent dielectric functions must exclude interstitial high dielectric regions in order to yield physically meaningful results.},

@article{Dong:2003,
	Abstract = {The contributions of electrostatic interactions to the binding stability of barnase and barstar were studied by the Poisson-Boltzmann model with three different protocols: a), the dielectric boundary specified as the van der Waals (vdW) surface of the protein along with a protein dielectric constant (epsilon (p)) of 4; b), the dielectric boundary specified as the molecular (i.e., solvent-exclusion (SE)) surface along with epsilon (p) = 4; and c), "SE + epsilon (p) = 20." The "vdW + epsilon (p) = 4" and "SE + epsilon (p) = 20" protocols predicted an overall electrostatic stabilization whereas the "SE + epsilon (p) = 4" protocol predicted an overall electrostatic destabilization. The "vdW + epsilon (p) = 4" protocol was most consistent with experiment. It quantitatively reproduced the observed effects of 17 mutations neutralizing charged residues lining the binding interface and the measured coupling energies of six charge pairs across the interface and reasonably rationalized the experimental ionic strength and pH dependences of the binding constant. In contrast, the "SE + epsilon (p) = 4" protocol predicted significantly larger coupling energies of charge pairs whereas the "SE + epsilon (p) = 20" protocol did not predict any pH dependence. This study calls for further scrutiny of the different Poisson-Boltzmann protocols and demonstrates potential danger in drawing conclusions on electrostatic contributions based on a particular calculation protocol.},

@article{Martinez:2015,
	Abstract = {The simulation of diffusional association (SDA) Brownian dynamics software package has been widely used in the study of biomacromolecular association. Initially developed to calculate bimolecular protein-protein association rate constants, it has since been extended to study electron transfer rates, to predict the structures of biomacromolecular complexes, to investigate the adsorption of proteins to inorganic surfaces, and to simulate the dynamics of large systems containing many biomacromolecular solutes, allowing the study of concentration-dependent effects. These extensions have led to a number of divergent versions of the software. In this article, we report the development of the latest version of the software (SDA 7). This release was developed to consolidate the existing codes into a single framework, while improving the parallelization of the code to better exploit modern multicore shared memory computer architectures. It is built using a modular object-oriented programming scheme, to allow for easy maintenance and extension of the software, and includes new features, such as adding flexible solute representations. We discuss a number of application examples, which describe some of the methods available in the release, and provide benchmarking data to demonstrate the parallel performance.},

@article{PIPSA,
	Abstract = {Protein molecular interaction fields are key determinants of protein functionality. PIPSA (Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis) is a procedure to compare and analyze protein molecular interaction fields, such as the electrostatic potential. PIPSA may assist in protein functional assignment, classification of proteins, the comparison of binding properties and the estimation of enzyme kinetic parameters. webPIPSA is a web server that enables the use of PIPSA to compare and analyze protein electrostatic potentials. While PIPSA can be run with downloadable software (see http://projects.eml.org/mcm/software/pipsa), webPIPSA extends and simplifies a PIPSA run. This allows non-expert users to perform PIPSA for their protein datasets. With input protein coordinates, the superposition of protein structures, as well as the computation and analysis of electrostatic potentials, is automated. The results are provided as electrostatic similarity matrices from an all-pairwise comparison of the proteins which can be subjected to clustering and visualized as epograms (tree-like diagrams showing electrostatic potential differences) or heat maps. webPIPSA is freely available at: http://pipsa.eml.org.},
